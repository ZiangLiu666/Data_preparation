0,US,21269168,RSH1OZ87OYK92,B013PURRZW,N,N,A slight improvement from last year.,"I keep buying madden every year hoping they get back to football. This years version is a little better than last years -- but that's not saying much.The game looks great. The only thing wrong with the animation, is the way the players are always tripping on each other.<br /><br />The gameplay is still slowed down by the bloated pre-play controls. What used to take two buttons is now a giant PITA to get done before an opponent snaps the ball or the play clock runs out.<br /><br />The turbo button is back, but the player movement is still slow and awkward. If you liked last years version, I'm guessing you'll like this too. I haven't had a chance to play anything other than training and a few online games, so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping the rest is better.<br /><br />The one thing I can recommend is NOT TO BUY THE MADDEN BUNDLE. The game comes as a download. So if you hate it, there's no trading it in at Gamestop.",2015-08-31

I am still playing Civ 4 and love it. It's a shame because I'm ready for an expanded version of Civ 4 and have waited for about a decade for a better version of it. Civ 5 was not an evolution but a total rewrite and it lost all that was good in Civ 4. I really hope that when Civ 6 comes out they use Civ 4 as the starting point and forget Civ 5 ever happened.

81,US,17746031,R2BYOTSDJJY65O,B00DRKJBC8,N,Y,An amazing game,"First of all, I never played the original PlayStation version, so this was my first experience with this game.  I haven't had the chance to complete it as there is a lot of gameplay, but so far, it is a very fun game.<br /><br />Final Fantasy VII is a turn-based JRPG.  However, there is a small twist from most turned based games in that instead of moving in a set order, you have a time gauge that fills up. Once full, you can input a move.  Moves are executed in the order they are put in.  This adds a real-time element to the battles.  This game has random encounters and there are a lot of them.  Enemies can be encountered everywhere with a few exceptions like towns and cities.<br /><br />The story is very good, and is told well.  Events are somewhat unexpected and keep you wondering what will happen next.<br /><br />The controls are easy enough to use.  You can play with the keyboard or use most pc-compatible controllers.  I would recommend using a controller.  The game feels a little better with a controller, and you can tell that it was designed for one.<br /><br />Probably the weakest point of the game is its graphics.  They are terrible.  This is somewhat understandable considering the age of the game, but it is still bad even by PS1 standards.  This version has slightly improved graphics, but it's not very significant.<br /><br />Overall this is a great game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes Final Fantasy or RPGs in general.  However, at this point it might be worth waiting for the HD remake that has been announced.",2015-08-31

154,US,39460981,R87TWWT7X9FZB,B013TOCFP6,N,N,The Cool AND Kitchen Stuff Pack- A nice (not a great) addition,"This set would have been better titled Cool AND Kitchen Stuff as it is a somewhat curious mishmash of a single new kitchen design, many new cooler temperature clothing items and an ice cream maker. The new kitchen design and related decor number 23 new build/buy items with the new wall artwork actually comprising 18 separate designs suitable for kitchen or retail use making the count 40 kitchen build buy items from that standpoint. The new look is an attractive modern design, not entirely different from what already exists but not the same either. I like the look and have used it several times already. One point of contention is the failure to make everything in the same range of colors. The refrigerator being the most glaring example. Why make everything in the kitchen color coordinate except the fridge? This is a running theme with this iteration of the Sims where the player is reliant on the MAXIS design expertise to chose correctly for the end user.<br /><br />There are around 25 ish clothing/ hair selections for men and women combined that, while not spectacular, are nice additions to the wardrobe. For anyone looking to pretend that the seasons change in the Sims 4 the clothing will work well for Fall and I do like most of the new choices.<br /><br />Then you have the ice cream machine with it's thirty flavors, five or so having a mood effect on your sims. The machine is a cute novelty but only a novelty with very little long term use. It's charm wears off quick and after the first couple of uses it comes to be relegated to the inventory box to save counter space. I did like the ice cream maker but I just don't see myself or others, by and large, using it often. A shame given it is the only new gameplay item in this pack.<br /><br />That said, the pack at around 50 items (plus 17 additional wall art variations) is worth the 10 dollars price tag. The are more than forty new items for use and a sim interactive piece (be it limited) in the ice cream maker. Skip buying two coffees from Starbucks and buy this pack instead- you'll enjoy it far longer and using Amazon, you don't even have to wait in line for it.ying two coffees from Starbucks and buy this pack instead- you'll enjoy it far longer and using Amazon, you don't even have to wait in line for it.",2015-08-30

I was able to download it to my PC without trouble, and to play it *almost* to the end.  Unfortunately, what I presume is about ninety percent of the way through the game, one part of the screen locked a picture into the game...and it wouldn't go away.  So 1/4 of my screen was taken up by a part of the game I didn't want to see at that time.  I couldn't even finish hidden object games within the game because the picture (it's a pop-out of a clue---a bed with a tear in the side) would not go off the screen.<br /><br />I loved the rest of the game.  The puzzles are easier than most games and not nearly as frustrating to figure out, and you don't have to walk a million clues and miles to find the object you need to open a door or gate.

278,US,12569493,RV4UH0OWW97K4,B0149HT55K,N,N,Mega Man Legacy Collection - Mega Man Comes to Next Gen!,"What is Mega Man?<br />---------------------------------<br />If you have been living under a gaming rock in the NES era, you are Mega Man, a blue robot that is out to take out some, well, the original concept was basically &#34;trade robots&#34; gone bad. It starts off with you selecting the robot you want to fight. However, before you can fight them, you have to get through their stage.<br />Each stage is usually based on the robot itself. Basically, &#34;Heat Man&#34; is going to have lava and fire. &#34;Wood Man&#34; will be a tree stage.<br />The game plays a lot like Super Mario, in that you jump a lot from platform to platform, but with a lot more control. You have a basic weapon (P) that is available from the very beginning. You will need to navigate the various challenges in each stage, and will face an end boss, which is the robot you picked. After taking them out, you will get a version of their weapon.<br />Each robot is weak to another robot's weapon. This will allow you to get through the game much easier. With that in mind, you will want to google the game you are playing and add the word &#34;Boss Order&#34; - at least for now. I would like to add a comment later that features all of the orders for all 6 gamers. It just makes the game a lot easier, and for most, passable.<br />You will find each game varies in difficulty. Mega Man 1 and 3 being much harder than 2 as an example, so it's fun to see what it takes to take out each adventure. For me, I was not able to beat Mega Man 1 without a lot of practice. Now, I can basically walk through the blue guy's adventure.<br />Mega Man has been one of those titles I have looked back with mixed emotions. I thought it was a great set of games, but I couldn't believe how hard it was.<br />The level of challenge can put off some gamers, but I do say ‚Äì keep trying, you will like it.<br /><br />My Reaction to the Collection:<br />-------------------------------------<br />So when I found out my favorite Nintendo collection was coming to PS4, I was pretty excited. Sure, the first thing I thought was, &#34;There was a Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PS2&#34;....and you are right. For those that do not know, there was a game collection for PS2 that featured...yes - all 6 NES Mega Man games. With that, do you want to pull out your PS3 that has backwards compatibility (early adopters only), or for most of us, that old PS2 and hook it up just to play these titles? No thanks. The ability to play it on my PS4, to live stream the footage with a push of a button without any extra hardware was very appealing.<br /><br />So what makes this different?<br />--------------------------------------------<br />Let‚Äôs get this out of the way first ‚Äì These are basically the original Nintendo (NES) games that you knew and loved. That is Mega Man 1-6 for the NES. In terms of the actual games themselves, other than a few performance improvements to frames in some places (though, this cannot be said by many‚Ä¶), it‚Äôs the same games.<br />What makes it different is the ability to do some challenges in the Challenge mode.<br />However, the &#34;Challenge Mode&#34; makes it worth it to pick up for next gen. The creators created various challenges for us tall to try to beat the fastest. On top of that, they have leaderboards!! It only shows the top 100, but you are able to watch their replay and see if you too can be the best. They vary from different sections of stages from various Mega Man's in the collection, boss rushes, and so much more. The even have a multi colored helmet system to determine if you were &#34;3 stars&#34; per challenge to push yourself to do better and better. Thanks a lot Angry Birds.<br />The Museum mode and Database has a TON of concept art for each game, stats for each enemy and boss as well as tips on how to take out some of those baddies.<br />There is also a full Music Player, which will allow you to go through some of your mega man favorite tunes, includingflash man‚Äôs stage (my favorite), any boss music, any music from any of the games, all available.<br />Within the game itself, they also allowed people to change it from the original FULL screen to wide screen and you can have it look like a TV screen did back in the day‚Ä¶those small features that you wouldn‚Äôt think would be appealing, have all been included.<br /><br />What is it like playing it on PS4?<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />I found it pretty easy to play it on my PS4, but I do have a confession. I used to play these games a lot on emulators for my PC, so have been used to using a PS style controller. With that being said, since it is a digital download, it‚Äôs great to sit on your couch and select the title and pick the next Mega Man you plan to tackle. For me, the live streaming was something I just started getting into (which have few watchers, but are appreciated) and that works great. I even used, on the fly, my Sony Wireless Gold headset and the live stream didn't miss an audio beat (see what I did there?). With being an early adopter, I found myself taking plenty of screenshots of me being on the leaderboards for some of the challenges - knowing I would be kicked off soon by other time bandits. (I am not jealous....ok‚Ä¶maybe a little).<br /><br />So you are asking, do you like it?<br />------------------------------------------<br />As a classic gamer myself who started on Atari and NES, Mega Man has a soft spot for being one of those series that I can come back to and feel like the frustrated kid I was back when I played it so many years ago. Being honest, I still have not completed 4-6. With that in mind, I have a lot of new fun to enjoy. If you tried to put this collection together on the original NES, you will pay hundreds. If you have the collection on PS2 or GameCube all ready, I am not sure you will truly need this. For myself, the convenience of this package and the time ill need to get through all the games and challenges, I coulnd‚Äôt be happier with my purchase. Maybe they will bring us the Mega Man X and PS2 games next. Here is hoping.<br /><br />These are the other Mega Man collections I was talking about previously:<br />[[ASIN:B00019HNNC Mega Man Anniversary Collection - PlayStation 2]] [[ASIN:B00019AZC8 Mega Man Anniversary Collection - Gamecube]]Within the game itself, they also allowed people to change it from the original FULL screen to wide screen and you can have it look like a TV screen did back in the day‚Ä¶those small features that you wouldn‚Äôt think would be appealing, have all been included.  What is it like playing it on PS4? ------------------------------------------------- I found it pretty easy to play it on my PS4, but I do have a confession.

283,US,11634984,R3QWE7MODQ4QXQ,B00TT6RAD6,N,Y,"great for GoTfans, but may not be for action addicts","This is an excellent game as long as you're not looking for a lot of intense action. It's really more like watching a movie or tv show, with interuptions for occassional battles of low intensity, that have arrows and other signals to show you what to do as long as you have fairly quick reflexes. Often it took me several tries to get the battle steps down for a win. There are 4 story lines, that follow original main characters unique to this game, that revolve around the House Forrester. These 4 main characters are either Forrester relatives or are closely connected.  You have to make many decisions that affect your relationship with other chacters who will remember what you said or didn't say, many of whom can become enemies or allies. Main charachters from the GoT tv and books are: Cercei, Tyrion, Danerys, the vicious Bolton son and John Snow. I've played the 5 available episodes and am eagerly looking forwards to the release of the final 6th episode (unknown date).  I found controls during the action sequences tricky at times but with repeated attempts made it through battle sequences which are short lived. Also, you have to read your choices and select one quickly, which makes picking the wrong one too easy or not making a choice in time.",2015-08-29
284,US,38322383,R14Y5ZK1QWIH85,B00KSLNI82,N,N,I totally disliked the beta of this game,"I totally disliked the beta of this game. I originally thought the game looked and felt like a cheap DLC for BF4. However, the retail release shows just how much work actually went into this game. If you're expecting Battlefield 4, forget it. You'll be disappointed. This isn't a military style shooter. Simply put, it's a cops and robbers themed shooter. The locations (maps) for the game are really befitting, too. They range from suburban neighborhoods to downtown locations. Map selection is great and I really like the urban feel of the game.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor though and don't compare Hardline to other games in the Battlefield series. If you do, you'll be disappointed. Sorely. Taken on its own though, it's excellent in its own right. There are a lot of small touches and details in the game that set it apart and give it its own identity. Personally, I think releasing the game under the &#34;Battlefield&#34; moniker was a bad decision that's hurt the title. It created a certain level of expectation regarding what people think the game should be rather than allowing them to be open to what it actually is. I should know. I was one of them.<br /><br />All in all, I'm a total convert.",2015-08-29

They give you the option to buy it because people are dumb, lazy and impatient. You can unlocked the first 3 monsters and12 hunters just by putting in the time. There is a new dlc that you have to purchase for the last 4 hunters and 1 monster. Also they're right about the campain, there isn't one, how ever there IS a solo mode however it has bots. This is a great game,il it is really fun, takes a bit to get used to some controls but once you have the hang of it it is really awesome. The monster is really cool too. Evrioments are spectacular (3rd person everironment is awesome.) Graphics and sound match it all. It can be a bit redundant but that is also in you, switch things up and try every monster and hunter type/character, each are unique in their own way. One thing I have noticed is that Hunt match wait times are crazy long, sometimes it's 5-10 min, so I prefer to play arena mode which is played a lot differently.

The game level design is very deep and similar to Rayman Origins and Trine.  The combat is turn-base so there are plenty of time to cast spells, cast healing, use healing portions, or plan for the next moves.  The graphic and story line are excellent and full of poetry; it has a fairy tale feeling like the old King's Quest series.  There are at least 4 different tree of skills for advancement.  As our adventure continue, other in-game characters will join our quest... a Disney type of quests that fit well for a child princess.

Having heard about this game I was so psyched to get to play most played game on xbox again on xbox one, it has only taken me 3 days to realise what a mistake I have made.<br /><br /> Story mode is same as always, redone cutscenes look great and its the same story we all played years ago. Despite the single player being good it is comparatively short, where this game shines is its multiplayer; oh dear.<br /><br /> What can I say about this multiplayer, having played across 4 of the previous games extensively this is one of the worst online experiences I have ever had on xbox live. If you have any competitive side at all the online will be hell, the shotgun online - the staple weapon which made the series so much fun is one of the most random gun's you will ever experience in a video game. Players will eat lead and moments later snipe you from miles away despite yourself having a clean low ping connection to servers. This doesn't happen rarely, this is almost every death. The fact they had a beta and is a remake and still managed to balls this up is heart breaking. Much like the halo series remake it is a clear cash grab to fans where development was rushed in order to get it out the door for the planned release window so they could move onto Gears 4. When a game is so fundamentally this broken with damage inconsistencies online it is clear patch's will not be able to fix what is a mess in the core of the game that even the original didn't experience somehow. Now I'm stuck with a digital copy gutted knowing I can't get my money back and I have now got  dead game on my hard drive.<br /><br /> If you want to play for the single player go ahead its a great (but short) blast for 6-8 hours but if you play for the multiplayer do not even bother even if your a hardcore fan and it really is a shame to say this.<br /><br />Well back to backwards compatibility for me.",2015-08-28

My internet connection is really fast, but I still like having installation CDs in my hands. It just saves headaches in a lot of ways.<br /><br />I see a lot of one star reviews here from people who just don't like Steam, and for what it's worth it took time for me to get used to it, but then I realized that Steam has a really useful feature. When patches and updates are released for games that run under Steam, it gets them and applies them automatically. That means no more fishing around in the download pages of tech support forums. I really appreciate that.<br /><br />I've also seen some complaints claiming that it isn't possible to install this on a new PC if you upgrade, but that is not true. I just did an extra install on my Win8 laptop and it ran just fine for 3 hours. Like other Steam games, you can't run the game in more than one place at a time, but as long as you exit the game on PC &#34;A&#34; before launching it on PC &#34;B&#34; there isn't a problem.<br /><br />I see a lot of other reviews complaining that it's so buggy that it's unplayable. I've seen some crashes myself and yes they're irritating, but at this point the game is as patched as it's ever going to get and I find it to be at least as solid as most of the other things I play.<br /><br />My last observation is that I just find this particular time period fascinating, and while this game might not be perfect, it's still better than any of the other pre-Napoleonic colonization games I've seen. So my advice if you're interested in this time period is find a copy of this game on CD, and don't freak out about Steam.",2015-08-27

It has a message pop-up that tells you to call the company and give them the code that only works for several plays. It says there is a 24 hour turnaround for the company to answer. It also tells you to send an email for the same reason if you do not want to call. I sent two emails and a email from the company said they would look into it. Almost a week and nothing. One of the messages also tells you to pay another $6.99 if you want more of the games you were promised. This is sold as a four pack. I had asked about hidden charges after the purchase (Amazon's Q and A) and was told that you only needed to pay the original $6.99. This was wrong. If I had known about the game code problems and the time limit I would never have purchased this game. I feel ripped off because the ad does not tell you about what happens after you pay. I also wonder why I was told the game was complete and there were no other costs. This is a bait and switch operation done by whoever wrote the ad.

However given the fallen elder god more credence than any other boss (Shang Tsung and Shao Khan. because he seems less imposing as villains from the latter, it's a great oppurtunity to give this mysterious fallen elder god vengeance he does so rightfully deserve! maybe the boss demon at the end, but i moat say Shinnok is finally officially (other than MK4, where he turns up more corrupted and an obsession to obtain all the realms in the name of Netherrealm heritage! it's mostly a time-oriented plague, causin multiple reverberations on an already unclear future for all the six realms, under this Kotal Khan and rhw secretive deceptive plans of Lord Shinnok. It's mostly a multiple time travel game, which in the end doesn't stop the onslaught of Edenian knights nor the powers of American  S.P. With a majority of hidden characters, intense music, ol bloodshed and gore, this game, perennial to any true fan since the fabrication in 1992. well into my 30's.....i can't wait! PS3 is what we have now, but that kombat has been dormate for nearly 9 years, still top rated in my book for 12 years now, which makes me 32. everybody needs a hobby. some scense, genuially abd always was, Mortal Kombat!!!!

485,US,47667828,R332MKARWMNNXC,B00N4YZEMI,N,Y,Engaging game (Steam required to play),"I had the original Sins Of A Solar Empire.  I was still playing it occasionally so I decided to get the updated version.  At first I was disappointed because it essentially is the original game - same interface, same voices, etc.  That went away after playing it though.  The AI is much better and the 3 races split into 6 (Rebel/Loyalist versions) makes very different strategies required for each and enough new ships to make building a fleet require some thought.  Just building a huge fleet and sending it off to a planet can be dangerous.  I've lost monster fleets to one starbase.  Thinking is always required!  Small maps play very fast but I'm usually using the Huge and Vast maps.  Those games last on average 12 hours and the strategies required in the beginning are very different than what you're using at the end.  Engaging and entertaining.  A good update on a quality game.<br />Oh, the only negative - Steam is required.  I hate Steam - I wouldn't have purchased the game if I noticed that detail before I bought it.  The game description failed to note that detail. Minus 1 star for that.  Second time that happened to me so I'm on the lookout for the fineprint.

And the teaching is never heavy-handed or boring. It's your option to pick up all the collectibles and read the extras about WWI. The graphics are beautiful in every way. The animation and ink style are fantastic and some of the best to come out of the new studios doing these indie titles. Each environment is spot on and the art direction is just superb! The puzzles range from pretty easy to medium, and this can be played by all ages more or less.<br /><br />There is humor and violence and appropriate material for such a serious subject as WWI. Coming from French developers you get a side of the story you may not be familiar with, though it involves everyone and history about every culture involved is included.

On top of all that, Ori and the Blind Forest boasts an emotionally resonate story and some of the best art direction on the market.<br /><br />You control Ori, a guardian spirit of the forest Nibel, who is separated from her Spirit Tree as a baby and raised by a maternal figure, Naru.  When the forest begins to die around them, Ori must leave her home to  realize her destiny as a guardian spirit and defeat the evil owl Kuro.  What follows is a simple, yet emotionally resonant story of love and friendship that is sure to soften even the most jaded of gamer hearts.<br /><br />On the gameplay side, Ori is a Metroidvania style platformer, meaning the player goes through various stages, unlocks powerups, and may return an unlock regions they'd missed.  What impressed me the most was how different Ori's power-ups were.  Typically Metroidvania games have powerups similar to...well, Metroid and Castlevania.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover Ori is a far more platforming-centric character with players keeping the character in constant motion.<br /><br />The controls are tight, level design encourages player experimentation, and the game's lack of handholding directions produces a genuine sense of accomplishment after solving puzzles or clearing a particularly difficult stage.  My only complaint is that Ori's jumps do feel a touch floaty at times, but not enough to diminish the experience.<br /><br />If you own an Xbox One or a capable gaming PC and love exploration platformers than &#34;Ori and the Blind Forest&#34; is is a MUST OWN!",2015-08-26

The graphics give this game character, but the voice acting put it over the top.<br /><br />The secrets also unlock historical narratives throughout the game which many of which are the basis for who/where you are fighting; it actually gives motivation to find them as opposed to a simple achievement.<br /><br />Did I mention fantastic voice acting?",2015-08-25

583,US,19346459,R4NU9RXJKCFPJ,B00CMSCV4Q,N,Y,Good,"Fun game.  The devs have made the game center around a main storyline/quest line, which is neat.  The character system is excellent - 1 character can play all classes. Dungeons are standard Rift/WoW type 'plow through' things. Trials are nice touch, where you focus on a single boss.  I still wish these games had a more Everquest 1 style combat, where you pull/kill 1 mob at a time.  The constant movement in the dungeons kills your ability to have a good chat (keyboard based).  Also the game is much like Rift/WoW/Tera where the ground lights up and you move. Simon-Says, blah blah.  This is challenging, but it gets repetitious. Dungeons/Trials also seem to use a global que that spans all servers in a datacenter, which is a nice touch. Que times seem to be about 5-20 minutes.<br /><br />The storyline / class system define this game. The story is FF style and has an epic feel, a welcome change from Rift and Tera where the story seems to be a tossed in hack.  The game also seems stable, after 3-4 weeks of play, I have not experienced any bugs or weird stuff.  The devs also discourage parsing/public shaming, which makes dungeons a little less stressful.  In Rift, it is fairly standard for groups to request DPS with  &#62; XX kdps or 'only purple' gear. That said, Rift's mentor system is excellent, and FFXIV could learn from it. In FFXIV, you can be leveled down, but it is automatic process for certain events (dungeons and special group content called Fates - kinda like a 'rift' in Rift).  Unfortunately, you can not manually level yourself down, this is unfortunate, as it makes doing low level quests boring if you out-level the area.",2015-08-25

The final couple sections of the game can be aggravatingly difficult with these buggy controls, and constantly having to switch back and forth between our two heroes doesn't help when you have to reorient yourself with every switch and a timed event threatening behind ya. (These sections feel built for co-op, so I suspect it's much more fun with an interested partner.)<br /><br />I hope the developers finetune their future products, as I'm definitely interested in what else they bring out if they continue this trip of mixing games and education and good ol' fashioned stories.<br /><br />It's worth a look if you're interested in any of those earlier things: First nations culture, climate change impacts, and especially storytelling in video games.

642,US,20398852,R1OOINPQ1E8NGH,B00PKX12L8,N,N,Who's afraid of the big bad wolf...,"I actually had no awareness of the source material before I played &#34;The Wolf Amoung Us&#34;. The Fable comicbook series was something I've never heard of, but I was aware of public television attempts to accomplish similar settings; A mash up of fairytales trying to coexist in and stay relevant in modern urban or cityscape setting. It's a more reoccuring fixation in the past few years, this retelling of fairy tales trend, and it's interesting to me personally in many ways. How do our fairy tales hold up to modern values? If confronted with modern day problems, how would they react? If given a different prespective are the villians still so evil and the heroes still so good?<br /><br />In this game, those questions are both confronted and addressed pretty well and is a good source of the story's' power over it's audience. Unlike other retellings and reimaginings, the Fable characters are both very aware of their histories as storybook characters and constantly make the audience aware of the traditional versions of their stories. Instead of the writer rewriting the characters so that they fit new sterotypes, the characters look upon the original grim versions of thier tales as a harsh sort of history that most of them are trying to move on from. It works very well. The personal struggles with change, pain, sadness, and most notably in the main character's case, regret add's to the story's harsh and mature tone in a very belivable way.<br /><br />Story wise, the genre is mostly a murder mystery, dipped in the sheep's clothing of a fantasy. The player takes charge of Bigby (yes, the Big Bad Wolf himself) who, after the fables fled their respective world and established they're community in the modern world, was charged with the task of law enforcer. Of course, one of the story's biggest pulls is the contridiction of that. Bigby was and is still seen by most of the other fables as THE villain and nobody really trusts him. Internally, Bigby also struggles with himself, he is raw power combined with a dark animalistic nature, but he is also incredibly lonely and sick of it. The player guides Bigby's actions throughout the season, both shaping the progress of Bigby's internal struggle and solving the external murder mystery.<br /><br />Adding to the story's power is the artwork and voice acting. The art is cell shaded just right to that of a harshly lit comicbook. It feels almost like a colored in noire film and reflects the gritty, angry, mood of the stories setting. The voice acting is brilliant, clear and very emotional. Telltale did a great job in this one. I loved every bit of this tale., he is raw power combined with a dark animalistic nature, but he is also incredibly lonely and sick of it.

Gone are the days of Grind mmorpg. Now square Enix paves the way to the new Cap mmorpg. You won't be able to do much as you will be subject to weekly/daily progress once you attain the new level of sixty. The good news is there is none. All the new end game gear is a copy paste of previous gear sets any standing level fifty player already had, and with the glamour system you can just dye your old gear to look like the new gear. The new playable race is almost unrecognized as you walk thru a crowded city filled with real players. It's the same body style as another existing race just with horns for ears not other difference. So the new race is a copy paste of something they already had. The female char of the new race is almost unrecognizable in crowed city amongst other races female chars and appearance style. The new zones are massive compared to the previous ones from a realm reborn. They went into great detail in the new areas. Visually spectacular doesn't do some of them justice, they are more like priceless works of art. The graphic bump to DX11 runs smooth and looks awesome. I ran every dungeon and raid, the game remained a smooth frame rate.  Sadly you will have to clear almost every new zone on foot as the last item that allows you to fly in each new zone. Is from a zone clearing quest, most of the time a dungeon at the end of a long chain quest. You will have to explore the zones on foot and clear most of the side quest to get key item to gain flight. So once you can fly, you can take quick lap around this mammoth sized zone and leave it to a new zone that you can't fly in because that's where your next quest are :-(.  The new raids are once again a copy paste of the original four raids, what I mean by this they use similar mechanics to the original binding of coils raids. I was overall disappointed. As it's the best running, looking, playing mmo in gaming. It just feels like some key components were just copy pasted color changed from stuff already in the game.<br />Pros:<br />Still art worthy of museum display. A story good enough to be its own book.

Didn't work second time either.<br />THANK YOU! I now have a $15 overage fee, and STILL NO GAME. So the total price of this travesty was over $20, and no product.<br />I think there was a problem with the game that came with the computer being installed, but used up free games - Amazon's activation code did not work there for the 'unlock key'. Every time I tried to go back to Amazon and try again, it wanted to download again!!! Then I saw something on the Amazon site about my computer not having the Amazon &#34;game installer&#34; so yes, I downloaded their game installer (could that not have been an important disclaimer to mention prior to purchase?)<br /><br />Amazon - why don't you just offer the pc version for a fair retail price<br />and quit making buyers jump through all these hoops (like having to REGISTER with Origin (and there goes more of my personal information)?<br /><br />Grrr! Had I known I had to register, I would have gone to Walmart and just bought the game.<br />The ONLY reason I bought the so called 'downloadable version' was so I didn't have to wait days for a CD in the mail.<br /><br />Not cool.

732,US,40751777,R1LRQTWZAI0Y4B,B0143EZYCW,N,N,Par 3,"I‚Äôm not a good golfer. I‚Äôve never been a good golfer. Golf is only really enjoyable to me playing a scramble (play from best ball). I play three to four times a year, enough to say I golf but not enough to ever really get good at it, so to me golf is hitting a ball a couple times and enjoying being outside on a nice day wandering around. I know it may be hard to see the connection between golf and Zombi, but truth is in the eye of the combatant. While Zombi offers up a lot of great ideas and a nice environment to wander around in the combat is unrefined and mostly comes down to swinging, and hopefully hitting things, a couple times and until something happens.   Zombi is a post-apocalyptic zombie survival game in which you are cast as a survivor that happens to stumble upon a prepper who lets you stay in his safehouse. If you die you are then cast as the next survivor stumbling into the safehouse, who is tasked with retrieving the supplies the last survivor had on them and continuing the story. Beyond the visual appearance and a name there is no difference from survivor A to survivor B. They move the same, they fight the same, they lay in bed curled up the same. You explore new areas, open up new paths and sneak or fight your way through zombies to move the plot forward. There are two different modes, one in which death means having to go find the supplies on your previous character, and a true rogue like mode in which death means game over and you must start over again from square one.   Where the game shines is in the well-crafted world in which it takes place. Exploration is interesting and there is always a feeling of wanting to know what‚Äôs around the next corner. Coupled with the need to gather supplies it makes for a lot of enjoyable wandering around looking for items. The characters you encounter, though infrequent, are intriguing and help draw you in.   Where the game doesn‚Äôt shine is the combat. The interest of wandering around is broken up with theboredom of combat, which is normally reversed. There are guns in the game, but bullets are rare so the majority of combat is done with one of a handful of melee weapons which you mash into zombies. Hit zombie, pull back, hit zombie, pull back, hit zombie and hope its head explodes or keep hitting it. It‚Äôs amazing with all the time put into making the world interesting they couldn‚Äôt have figured out some better combat mechanics than hit it in the face over and over.   The zombies are more Walking Dead than Left for Dead, garden variety slow lumbering creatures that you can plan around and really only interact with when necessary. There is a ‚Äúprepper pad‚Äù that allows you to examine the world and see if it‚Äôs worth looting a container or a dead zombie, but it feels cumbersome having to scan everything. It would be nicer if it automatically lit up containers and zombies appropriately and only made you scan objects as necessary rather than needing to scan everything.   The graphics are subpar, but it is a Wii U port and a downloadable game so it can be overlooked. Sound effects won‚Äôt blow you away, and the voice acting is about average.   For a game I enjoyed throwing time at, it‚Äôs surprisingly hard to recommend. There isn‚Äôt a lot of downside since the price is relatively low for the content you receive, but the dull combat and subpar graphics are real detractors from a game whose major positive is wandering around looking for things. It‚Äôs a different take on the zombie genre, and is actually a fun game if it weren‚Äôt for the combat. Zombi ends up in a tough spot where it‚Äôs not really casual enough to just enjoy the exploring, but it‚Äôs not refined enough to be a good survival horror game. In the end I enjoyed the game, but it‚Äôs a lot like golf to me, enjoying wandering around broken up by hitting things a couple times.",2015-08-24

You get to test different DNA like plants, minerals and sims.

Along with that you can also create potions to make or break other sims, it's all in a matter of preference-<br />THE ALIENS. I love them, especially the children because they have the cutest voices. Your male sim can get abducted by aliens also and get pregnant, which is fun. But the downside is that you can get abducted TOO much.

Game mechanics such as basic platforming and puzzle solving are all included. Take Prince of Persia and mix it together with Super Metroid and Braid, and this yields Teslagrad.<br /><br />Graphics/Style - The art work seems to be completely hand drawn.  It's beautiful to the point where the backgrounds still resonate in my brain after playing.<br /><br />Music / Sound Effects - The music is both pleasant and engaging and does not distract the player from concentrating on the game. Sound effects work well with the style of the game.<br /><br />Story - Young Boy is being chased by bad guys into a tower. He quickly discovers that the tower is not what it seems, and holds special powers and abilities. Guide him through the tower avoiding unique monsters and traps.<br /><br />Replay-ability - There are many secrets to find in Teslagrad. Some backtracking is required to find them all, similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.<br /><br />Time Commitment - Once you exit the game, your progress is automatically saved. Perfect for when you need to drop what you are doing and come back right away. Can be played in short bursts, but this game grabbed my attention for several hours in a row.<br /><br />Value - This is extremely worth the entry price of $9.99 and frequently goes on sale on Steam.  It is a well polished adventure that should not be missed by any fans of the Genre.<br /><br />Multiplayer - None<br /><br />Favorite Element - Although the abilities are what grabbed my attention initially, the art style is very well done. The theater scenes are beautiful, and I love how Teslagrad manages to tell a complex story without using hardly any dialogue.<br /><br />We were fortunate enough to receive a PC copy of Teslagrad from Rain Games for review. This game has exceeded all expectations and is exactly the type of game a busy parent can squeeze in a little bit of gameplay at a time, or have a marathon adventuring session.  Immediately, one will notice that there isn't much dialogue in Teslagrad, and quite frankly I like it that way.  I don't have the time to read pages and pages of dialog, or sit through tons of cinematic scenes.  The art direction in Teslagrad is amazingly well done, and captures the overall feel of a unique tower setting that is full of mystery.<br /><br />The game play is quite simple, utilizing basic platforming similar to Braid or Super Metroid with very tight controls. One can play with a controller and execute precise moves to advance throughout the tower.  Where Teslagrad excels is the magnetic powers that are gained early on in the game. Without spoiling too much, eventually you get to utilize magnetic pulls of blocks, floors, and platforms throughout the areas. This allows the player to traverse throughout the tower with ease.  Other abilities are gained as the game progresses, such as the ability to walk through gates.<br /><br />Overall this game is worth a play, especially if you are a fan of the genre. The game obviously takes inspiration from such classics as Super Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and Prince of Persia.  The price of entry is well worth the experience, and if you haven't done so already check it out!<br /><br />Chris Chandler - GamingWithSwag.comcopy of Teslagrad from Rain Games for review.

834,US,11391552,R1LEE669UD0W9M,B00VKW9NXW,N,Y,"Slow-paced and relaxing, STEEP learning curve","I was able to run this game at smooth, playable framerates on a Dell Latitude e6400 laptop with the following specifications:<br /><br />OS:  Windows Vista Business 32-bit<br />CPU:  2.26 GHz Core2Duo<br />RAM:  4 GB DDR2-800<br />GPU:  Nividia Quadro NVS 160m (256 MB graphics memory)<br />HDD:  500 GB, 5400 RPM<br /><br />I run the game at my laptop's native resolution of 1280x800.  HDR lighting is turned off, but view distances and texture quality can easily be left at their maximums.  Given that the e6400 is a business class laptop from late 2008, I think most people will find that their computers are more than enough to offer a playable experience.  IMPORTANT!!! - Make sure you install the DirectX SDK stuff that the game asks you to load at the end of the install.  It must have all that junk loaded in order to actually start despite it looking almost optional when it prompts you if you'd like to load it.  An external mouse is almost a must-have for me with UC as I feel a touchpad doesn't offer the fine control needed to pilot space fighters in a dogfight or handle situations when you're on a planet surface.<br /><br />If your computer is a complete dinosaur with integrated graphics, you might want to try the original Universal Combat with is just as free as the much newer Collector's Edition 2.0 here on Amazon.  You can find it available on 3000AD's website or via your favorite search engine.  It runs on less capable hardware (I had some success getting that version to work on a Windows 7 netbook with an Intel Atom n270 CPU and Intel GMA 950 graphics card where it was a little bit slow, but still playable) and offers much of the underlying game mechanics of this version.<br /><br />I've been interested in and occasionally playing 3000AD games for a while now, starting with Battlecruiser Millennium and I played the original CD-ROM release of Universal Combat.  Make no mistake, the game isn't easy to learn.  It has a complicated, unintuitive UI and the controls are difficult to remember.  While the tutorial scenario does get the basics established (look in the documents folder of the game directory after you finish the install), I found I needed to run it a couple of times to fully grasp what I was doing and even then, UC is positively unforgiving to new players.  In addition to the complexity, the graphics are quite dated (though they've gone through several major updates that have improved them dramatically) and you're not going to find yourself being blown out of your seat by music and sound.  I find the music is decent but the sound effects strike me as more utilitarian, getting the point of what's going on across rather than conveying a lot of wow-factor.<br /><br />Despite all that, I really do enjoy playing the game.  Since UC attempts to realistically simulate space, there are times when you have to wait for things to happen.  I find being able to kick back in my chair and let the ship's crew or maybe my on-planet mining robots do their thing while I read a book as relaxing.  The sheer ability to take your alter ego (AE - the game's terms for your character) from commanding a gigantic carrier and leave the command chair to hop into a shuttle that you land on a planet only to go for a walk and maybe grab the nearest unoccupied tank to drive around with is a really amazing concept.  In ROAM scenarios, you're absolutely free to pursue whatever activities you want given the equipment available to you based on your career path.  This is very much a slow-paced sandbox simulation so if you can get over the steep learning curve and don't mind the numerous ways your bungling can foil your plans (forever in a given scenario since you can't restore a saved game after your AE dies) then you're in for a treat.<br /><br />If you're going to give it a whirl, I humbly suggest either having a second device on hand (a second computer or a tablet) to display the tutorial and game manual or printing out a copy on paper.  Don't forget toprint out the keyboard commands too AND remember to peruse the other stuff in the game's docs folder as there's a lot of useful information in there.  You may even want to snag a used copy of the game that includes a paper manual (I've got the much older Universal Combat Collector's Edition 1.0 DVD box with its instruction booklet).  Be patient and give yourself a few weeks to really start to learn the game before you throw in the towel.  UC takes time and actual effort to learn so you really can't just install it and dive in like you can with most other games.<br /><br />As of the time this review was written, the 3000AD team is getting ready to release an expansion pack that will add some new things to Universal Combat Collector's Edition 2.0 which is why I believe they've released it for free.  I was previously under the impression that UC was being shelved for good because of its limited market appeal, but I'm happy to see that it's getting a bit of attention through an expansion.",2015-08-23

859,US,40702997,RG6GT6G9WNYT1,B013XJ2M8M,N,N,A multiplayer masterpiece that's easy to learn and hard to master,"At its core, Rocket League is a pretty simple game. You have two teams of cars. They play soccer. They also have rockets that let them boost. That's the game. From this simple setup comes a nearly infinite amount of strategies and possibilities, which adds a surprising amount of depth to the game. The controls are spot-on, allowing extremely precise plays and the physics feel natural, despite the bizarre scenario the game presents. The gameplay is fun and addictive, creating a &#34;just one more game&#34; mentality. Everytime you hit the ball feels satisfying and powerful. In terms of features, the game allows 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 matches, with both ranked and unranked play. The splitscreen mode is a welcome offering and something not seen often on PC. There are also training modes to help you practice shooting and protecting your goals, which is nice. There could be some more variety in the arenas (all of them are functionally identical)  and some more game modes, such as a demolition derby would be nice, but we're still pretty early in the game's life cycle and the developers have promised some &#34;crazy&#34; arenas as free updates, so I think some more variety is on the way. I was initially skeptical at the $20 price point for such a seemingly simple game, but that was before I played it. I have absolutely gotten my money's worth. All of my friends play this as well and our office has even organized a league with seasons and tournaments. Highly recommended!",2015-08-22

I found out one day that one of my drinking buddies in West Seattle was the creator of this game.  Our conversation started out discussing video games, and I said Dungeon Siege was my favorite because you can form your own raid-team, gear and control them.  It's kind of like playing an entire Warcraft raid by yourself.  His response &#34;THAT'S MY GAME!!!&#34; I had never put two and two together that this red-headed dude named &#34;Chris&#34; was &#34;Chris Taylor&#34; before then!<br /><br />I like that you can power up and gear up your squad to be specialists or hybrids.  Do you need them to switch to healing really quick?  Just pause the game and do it!  Which brings to mind a quote from Southpark where Stan's mom tells him to &#34;pause&#34; Warcraft so he can come eat dinner.  &#34;But mom, you can't pause the world&#34; ...  &#34;Why not?&#34;  ... &#34;Because it's...

I was completely wrong.  I fell in love immediately-- the scenery is stunningly beautiful, surprisingly realistic, and very vivid.  Graham is such a lovable character, as an old grandfather and a young amateur knight too.  The other characters are very creative and fun to interact with.  What I like best about it is the puzzles-- each one takes effort and thinking to solve, but they are far impossible (like KQ6's catacomb sequence or guessing the gnome's name in KQ1).  The game does not let you progress without an essential item, and there are many opportunities to retry and redo failed tasks.  Another thing I liked is the length of chapter 1, which is the only chapter released, but it took me two days to complete (I was resting due to having oral surgery so I sat and played it for hours at a time!) I love it, and I can't wait to see what the next chapter has in store! I'm so excited!",2015-08-22

947,US,40702997,R2NSZAL0DOBYF8,B00G9BNIVM,N,N,"A bland, uninspired platformer with nothing to offer.","Superfrog HD is a remake of an old Amiga game. This had my interest piqued because I love 16-bit era platformers, but unfortunately Superfrog HD just isn't very good. This is a very basic platformer, modeled heavily after the original Sonic the Hedgehog. Superfrog runs fairly fast (though not as fast as Sonic) and the levels have the types of ramps and springs (though no loop-de-loops) similar to what you would see in Sonic. Superfrog can attack by throwing a green ball that has eyes on it a somewhat short range. The attack is bland and uninteresting, and really doesn't feel satisfying when you hit things with it. Superfrog is supposed to be some kind of superhero, at the very least some kind of fireball would have been more interesting than a green sphere with eyes. Moving superfrog is reasonably responsive, with a somewhat floaty jump that allows decent air control, but he has no weight or momentum, which makes the platforming shallow and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The level designs are another area where the game falls flat. As mentioned before, the levels borrow things like hills and springs from Sonic, but fail to arrange those things in a meaningful or challenging way. They exist, but they're just sort of there and don't add any kind of thrill to the game. Furthermore, despite the fact that the game splits its levels into worlds, each level is more or less the same thing, but with a different paint job. The game does nothing to switch up the experience or even to really increase the challenge over time, and the idea of a &#34;difficulty curve&#34; is pretty much nonexistent, as every level is pretty easy. Each level is filled with collectibles, but none of these actually matter, and all you have to do is get to the end of the level. Apparently the original Amiga game requires you to collect X number of coins before leaving the level, which does seem like it would make the levels more interesting, and you can unlock a mode that has that requirement by beating the game, but by the time I beat the game (which took about 3 hours), I was so bored, I had no desire to play any more. At the end of each world, there is a boss fight. The villain of this game is a stereotypical green witch, like you would see in any dollar-store Halloween decoration. Real creative, guys. Each boss fight is identical, with the only difference being the layout of platforms on the screen, and the fights are trivially easy, adding nothing to the game.<br /><br />In terms of graphics and sound, the game is also pretty bland. It has a cartoony look, but lacks any real sense of &#34;style&#34;. The visuals are flat and bland, and to be honest, the screenshots I've seen of the Amiga version actually look way more detailed, textured. and &#34;artistic&#34;. The only slightly interesting thing about the visuals is that one of the worlds is almost a one-to-one copy of Scrap Brain Zone from Sonic 1, and that was only good because the thing it was ripping off was good. The game's camera is something of a nuisance, constantly zooming in and out, almost to the point of nausea. The music is all completely forgettable as well, so much so that I honestly don't remember enough about it to comment on.<br /><br />Superfrog HD is one of the most bland, forgettable games I've played. It functions in the sense that it isn't glitchy and does what it tries to do, but when a game lacks ambition like this one does, that's not saying much. It lacks creativity and challenge, with no sense of its own identity. There are plenty of great platformers from the early 90's, like Sonic and Rocket Knight Adventures that are still fun to play, so I'd say track those down instead. Sonic 1 and 2 are five dollars each on Steam (compared to ten dollars for this game) and those games are much more compelling, engaging, and fun than this one. I may try the 16 bit version of Superfrog one day, because it does seem a little better than this version in some ways, but for now, Superfrog is one gamebest left in the past.best left in the past.",2015-08-22

1031,US,25980349,R3D0PZYCAEC9M5,B00ENQXEX2,N,Y,Sims Continues to Progress,"I've had this game for awhile but didn't want to write a review until I had played it many times and felt I had the hang of it. Other reviewers have totally bashed it for numerous reasons, but if you're a lifetime Sim-er (I still do long for the days of the original Sims, though that's probably nostalgia speaking) you know that there are always major changes when a new version of the Sims is put out.<br /><br />I think that my favorite part about Sims 4 is the speed. It runs SO FAST. You are no longer sitting around forever waiting for the town to load, or for your game to save. Another thing I like, and this is minor, but you can age up your child right after giving birth! I know a lot of people griped about there not being a toddler anymore and whatever, but come on, who REALLY likes taking care of a Sim baby? Not me. I didn't think that I would care about the ability to change aspirations anytime you like, but I've found that I like it. I think what makes this game stand apart from other versions, and is what the creators are continuously trying to do with this series, is that the Sims have more options as to what they can do. Also, the ability to multitask (talk and do just about anything else), is GREAT. I think that a lot of changes have also been made since this version first came out, so a lot of the original reviews complain about things that have since changed or been fixed.<br /><br />What don't I like about this version? I think the simplicity that used to be the Sims. As the Sims series has progressed, so have computer games in general, and there are far fewer limitations as to what can be done. I like playing each new version and still find myself sucked into this and playing it for hours on end, but it doesn't grab me as much as the previous versions did. So maybe that's my age and self-restraint growing, or maybe it speaks to how the game has changed. Who knows. I do know that if I had gotten that free code to download Sims 2 a year ago I would have been so happy right now on my CD-drive-less computer. So yeah, I would choose the other versions over this one, but that could be because I'm so used to them. For what it's worth, this version is great and has a lot to offer.been so happy right now on my CD-drive-less computer.

One would hope the modifications would extend to the strategic level of playing as well, but it leaves unchanged my one big complaint about this series; realm divide. Once you get too powerful, every faction turns against you, including vassals and other lines in your own faction, regardless of how close they were to you prior to some arbitrary point in the game. It turns the campaign into a long, slog of attrition. You are forced to maintain large armies adjacent to allies because they will, eventually, predictably, turn against you. Small enemy factions engage in suicidal attacks that make no sense if they were interested in their own survival just because they are tools of the AI in fighting against you. So I enjoy the early parts of the campaigns but get bored quickly upon reaching the realm divide tipping point. Diplomacy and AI strategy has never been this series' strong point.",2015-08-21

1133,US,42700429,R1KF4E7CGG74Y7,B00GGUEKGS,N,N,"Ever want to launch a Bumble Ball with people, animals and buildings on it into space?","My taste in games has always been pretty diverse. Heck, one of my favorites is Seaman on the Dreamcast, which is essentially a virtual psychiatrist that just happens to be a human/fish hybrid pet. In 2006, one of my friends was taking pictures of Katamari Damacy and posting them on his site. I had no idea what I was looking at, but I trusted him when he said something was good (most of the time), and the next day, I went out and bought the only copy the game store near me had. It was brand new and bargain priced. A few months later, the game would be very hard to find due to the overwhelming popularity it got from word of mouth.<br /><br />Now that you can go online and easily watch videos of gameplay for any game out there, it‚Äôs easy to look up stuff on Katamari Damacy and find out if it looks interesting to you or not. Back then though, I was just going by what I heard. You play as a tiny prince from space who rolls around a Bumble Ball-like object that makes things stick to it, picking up bigger and bigger things as it grows, then it gets launched into space by a giant king to become a constellation? WHAT? The game was so weird and yet it had this undeniable charm that made it accessible to everyone. The graphics are very basic and borderline PlayStation One quality. Does this matter? No. The soundtrack is made up of all kinds of music, from lounge to a little kid choir to techno. You control the direction you roll the katamari with both analog sticks, pressing them both forward to move it straight forward, both left to move straight left, and move one in one direction while the other goes in another to get it at the right angle. It takes just a few minutes to get used to, and when you do, playing the game is a breeze, and most importantly- fun.<br /><br />And that‚Äôs where Katamari Damacy shines- the game is extremely fun to play! I recently got it on PSN because it‚Äôs still the best game in the series, and I missed the old music. I jumped right into it without any issues, only failing to clear a level one time because I couldn‚Äôt get a good rhythm going. Everything in this game meshes together perfectly; it‚Äôs hard to find anyone who hates this game unless they‚Äôre just the kind of person who only plays a specific type of game and nothing else.<br /><br />There‚Äôs never any variation in the levels or objectives. Each level has you rolling up objects with your katamari, usually to make a constellation once you‚Äôre done. Some levels have you inside a home, smaller than a mouse, rolling up tiny things like paper clips, ants, gumdrops, erasers, etc. and once the katamari gets bigger, you‚Äôll move on to plates, books, utensils and more. Other levels have you outside, picking up plants from a garden, clothing and pets‚Ä¶then going up to people, vehicles, buildings, and even monuments and giant monsters battling each other. Trust me, the katamari gets HUGE later on. If they wanted to, the makers could‚Äôve turned this into a straight up horror game, with this little cutesy object that makes everything it touches stick to it, then throwing it into space where it‚Äôs a sure thing that whatever‚Äôs still alive on it is going to be toast.<br /><br />But no, it‚Äôs a cute, happy game!<br /><br />It‚Äôs a shame that none of the sequels ever matched the greatness of this one. Practically every sequel reused levels from Katamari Damacy over and over again, making the franchise very stale. Each game also became more aware of itself, -trying- to be funny and weird instead of just being weird on its own. Of the series, I recommend this one before any of the others, not just because it‚Äôs the first but because it really is the best. After that, I‚Äôd suggest trying out Me and My Katamari for the PSP if you have a way of playing it, because it had a fairly cute story and some fun levels with animals. From there, the rest of the games all feel the same. At the very least, play this one! It‚Äôs hard to not enjoy it!",2015-08-20

1198,US,40702997,R3OWMETPYI1H3W,B009IXNPDE,N,N,The definition of average,"Kane and Lynch is an odd game. For every good idea it has, there is an equally bad idea to balance it out. As the title suggests, the game is about Kane and Lynch, two mercenaries trying to get revenge on a mercenary group they used to work for. This plays out in typical third-person shooter fashion, with genre standards like cover system, squad mates, etc.<br /><br />The gameplay is a mixed bag. The guns themselves feel and sound punchy when they hit what you're aiming at, but all of them are almost comically short ranged, making for an odd combat dynamic. It's not particularly bad, mind you, but it did feel like I was running out into the open more often than what was sensible. Speaking of running out into the open, this game's cover system is completely broken. You're sort of supposed to push yourself up against whatever you want to duck behind, but I can count the number of times that actually worked right on two fingers. It's easier to just stand or crouch behind whatever you're trying to hide behind than to mess with this game's broken attempt at cover. The game also has some weird design choices, for example, the tutorial is actually in the second level, after you've spent an entire level shooting your way through enemies. The problem is, that first level doesn't give you any kind of instruction on what button to press when it wants you to do things like go into cover or climb onto something, so for that level, you're constantly checking the options menu to find out what button you're supposed to press, only to have the game try and teach you after you spent all that time trying to figure things out on your own. The one thing this game does to genuinely well is the squad system. It's fairly standard, you tell teammates where to guard, what to shoot, whether to hang back, but it's useful and works well. I also have to commend the games inclusion of split-screen co-op. I haven't played this mode myself, but it's fairly rare to see split-screen on a PC shooter, so I respect its inclusion. Overall, the gameplay is odd, and broken in places, but it's playable and even has bursts of &#34;hey, this is cool&#34;<br /><br />The graphics are another example of how this game is all over the place. It came out in 2007, so looking a bit dated is excusable, but this looks like it got trapped in a sort of awkward tranitionary period between PS2 era graphics and Xbox 360-era graphics, something more akin to a game from 2004. Other games from 2007, such as Call of Duty 4 and The Orange Box  were much more consistent and generally looked a lot better than this game does. The characters themselves look decent, except when beards (which look terrible in this game) are involved, featuring reasonably modern graphics techniques such as normal maps and whatnot (basically, the old wrinkly people you play as look old and wrinkly), but props and environments (including weapons), look like something from a PS2-era game, blocky and angular, with basic, low-resolution textures. Outdoor environments actually look fairly decent, being reasonably large and detailed, with good use of color and decent lighting, but indoor areas have a barren, almost abandoned feeling. This would be fine if you were supposed to be going through abandoned areas, but this game sends you through heavily populated areas such as banks and nightclubs, making these segments of the game feel odd and empty, and failing to convince me that I'm moving through and actual world. The buildings feel like they were just constructed and no one moved in yet, devoid of many of the props you would see in other games. One cool graphical thing this game does have going for it is that it features absolutely massive crowds. There are tons of people in places like the aforementioned nightclub, and they move out of your way and react in a surprisingly convincing way.<br /><br />Finally, let's talk about the storyline. I just could not care about this story or any of the people in it. It's cool that you get to play as an unambiguously bad set of characters, but the storytelling is poorly executed. Basically the group of assassins Kane and Lynch worked is trying to get back the money they think Kane took. When Kane fails to get the cash, they do a bad thing (I won't spoil what on the off chance someone actually cares), so Kane and Lynch try to get their revenge. It's an interesting setup, but none of the characters are ever fleshed out enough to make me want to care. The past relation ship between Kane and the group isn't explained much, so their rivalry fails to be interesting, and neither Kane nor Lynch are interesting enough for me tor really latch on to either. You can have an interesting story about a complete amoral character (The recent film, &#34;Nightcrawler&#34; is an excellent example), but that's not the case here. Every character is kind of an idiot, and the worsening of their problems is always their own fault, making them more annoying than cool. You eventually pick up three side characters who serve as your &#34;squad&#34;, and while their gameplay function is interesting, they serve almost no purpose to the story, and are basically nothing more than names. Their relation to Kane and Lynch is never explained and other than one or two offhand lines, they get no characterization other than &#34;unpleasant&#34;. The game wants to be a Michael Mann crime revenge story, but has neither the style nor charm to do so.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a terrible game, but it's not particularly great either.  It's certainly not worth the $7 price being asked, but if you can get it for $1.25 (which it drops to frequently), it's not the worst thing you could play. The game lasts about 6 hours, so it's okay as a &#34;weekend game&#34; that you can beat and forget about.guously bad set of characters, but the storytelling is poorly executed.

1208,US,40751777,R3J2KJKWY7VYV3,B00LAGGTRQ,N,N,The Light Show,"Infamous First Light is a standalone expansion to Infamous Second Son. It offers a stripped down campaign prequel which follows Fetch from Second Son on her path to ending up who she in Seattle. How you go into the game will affect how you feel about it. If you go into expecting a light version of Second Son you‚Äôll be disappointed by the short campaign in First Light. If you go into it expecting something like Infamous 2‚Äôs Festival of Blood you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised at how much more content there is in the game.<br /><br /> The game, as I mentioned before, follows Fetch leading up to the events at the beginning of Infamous Second Son. I won‚Äôt give any of the plot other than to say the story is somewhat inconsistent with the background given in Second Son. It goes over her past with the drug dealers and the D.U.P., but there is one critical event that is a pretty big stretch in First Light from what was mentioned in Second Son. Other than Delsin appearing in some arena challenges I‚Äôll go into later and a brief cameo by Hank and Eugene the only character from Second Son involved in First Light is Augustine. There are no moral choices and only one way the game can end. You level up by using SP‚Äôs (skill points) which you gain by collecting Lumens throughout the city (think Neon blast shards) and by completing challenges. The Neon powers you have are basically the same ones from Second Son.<br /><br /> The campaign itself is a couple hour visit back to Seattle‚Äôs northern half with a handful of world events. The city itself feels empty compared to Second Son. Without the D.U.P. throughout the city or the numerous world events it feels like everyone‚Äôs gone on vacation leaving the city relatively barren. It also feels like there are significantly fewer pedestrians wandering the streets than in Second Son, but it may just be a consequence of the lack of other things taking up space in the city. Campaign missions are, for the most part, go here, kill that, move on. There isn‚Äôt a lot of depth or variety to what‚Äôs being done, though the story that encapsulates the plot is fairly interesting.<br /><br /> The major addition to the game is an arena system where you play survival or rescue style arena games attempting to rack up points. You can play as Fetch, or if you own Second Son (not sure how they determine own, maybe just have it installed) you can also play as Delsin in the arena. There are three different arenas, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Alpha and Beta both have hostage rescue and survival style matches while Gamma only has survival. I‚Äôm not usually a fan of arena style matches and this is no different. You face increasingly difficult waves of enemies as you either try to survive as long as possible or not let hostages die and survive as long as possible. It ends up being fairly repetitive and the matches felt like they took far longer than they did. I‚Äôd feel like I‚Äôd be grinding away for a half hour, look at the timer on the match and I had only been at it for twelve minutes.<br /><br /> The graphics are the exact same as Second Son so they look very good. Voice acting is well done and sound effects have weight to them.<br /><br /> I know this isn‚Äôt the most glowing review of a game, and that‚Äôs mostly because it‚Äôs comparing it to big brother Second Son. When compared to that it‚Äôs a stripped down, light version of the game. But, when compared to other $15 downloadable titles out there First Light is an all-star. For its price tag and peers there‚Äôs a lot of great content. It doesn‚Äôt have the potential longevity of say a Fat Princess or Castle Crashers, but it‚Äôs hard to beat at the $15 price tag with the quality of content. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for some more Infamous Content.",2015-08-19

1216,US,11924468,R2AXAUEDMGEVYZ,B00JU9NV3K,N,Y,"Amazing game, makes up for the mistakes in Dragon Age 2","I pretty much love everything about this game. If you are expecting anything resembling the mechanics of the first Dragon Age game, then you might be disappointed. I consider this game similar to what Mass Effect 3 is for the Mass Effect series: streamlined combat and leveling up system.<br /><br />What's amazing about this game is the art direction and artistic style. The artistic elements first seen throughout Dragon Age 1 and 2 (the portraits on the wall; the loading screen art in Dragon Age 2) are fully developed in Dragon Age: Inquisition. The 'tarot cards' are really fantastic and adds a great style to the game. The 'style' translates into the armor/clothing your characters can wear. In Dragon Age: Inquisition, pretty much all the armor looks 'cool' to wear. If you play on high graphical settings, the texture details of armor/clothing really stand out. Velvet looks velvety, leather looks leathery. Details look great on character faces as well. On high graphic settings, this game looks amazing.<br /><br />The art direction also relates to the explorable land in the game. There are different types of land to explore: gloomy swamp, desert, lush green forest, stormy coast. Each land is incredibly diverse and detailed.  There are numerous different types of plants and minerals you can harvest from each land, similar to picking plants in Skyrim. Plants can be used for potions, minerals can be used to upgrade armor.<br /><br />It is clear that Bioware/EA listened to the complaints people had for Dragon Age 2. Some complaints included: lack of explorable areas, short completion time, and lack of customizable armor. It's almost funny how much content Inquisition has, which makes up for the past mistakes. You can easily surpass 100 hours of game play due to the large amount of content the game has. Your previous choices in the other Dragon Age affect the outcome of Inquisition. It's interesting to see how things develop in the story line.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this game, especially if you like games like Skyrim or The Witcher. Of course, I would recommend this game to Dragon Age fans as well. Forgive the mistakes of Dragon Age 2 and give Inquisition a try!!",2015-08-19

Set decades after the first game, the basic premise is the same - you and your people need water. Your village is suffering the worst drought on record and the elder tasks you with finding the GECK (Garden of Eden Creation Kit), so after a short tutorial, off you go.<br /><br />How and where you look is all up to you. Wildly different options are available to create and customize your character. You can be a skilled thief or hacker, bypassing threats with guile and traps. You can be a gunslinger or musclebound freak destroying everything in your path. You can even be a thoughtful speaker, finding peaceful and diplomatic solutions to almost all situations (I've never been able to fully commit to this, but I've heard you can complete the game with almost no combat  - unfortunately you can't talk down all the bad guys in this one). The fact that all these playstyles are viable is incredibly impressive and rewarding.<br /><br />The SPECIAL system dictates what options are available to you and your skill points how effective you'll be using them. If your character is a low-intellect fighter you won't see all dialogue options; if he (or she) finds a heavy weapon, you'd better make sure you're skilled in its use or things are probably going to fail spectacularly.<br /><br />This is a difficult game that rewards exploration and consideration on how to tackle the current problem using the tools and skills you have available. As you progress your actions will gain you reputations in the different areas you visit, as well as Karma, your overall fame/notoriety. One of the early examples of plot and game-changing decisions, Fallout 2 is also one of the best examples of choice and consequence in games. You will have an effect on the world and you'll feel it in the way people and things change. You'll uncover many interesting characters and situations (and a number of dated pop-culture references). The music is good and the voice acting is quite good. The art style has held up well, but this is a 17 year old semi-3D game and the graphics are what you'd expect, with almost no options to change or improve them. If you played it before, you might be surprised at how dated it looks and feels.<br /><br />But it's still absolutely beautiful after all these years to explore the irradiated lands.<br /><br />Leave the comforts of your home and see if what you do and find can help you preserve it when you (if you) make it back.ecisions, Fallout 2 is also one of the best examples of choice and consequence in games.

My only complaint is that if you are on line and don't touch the program for a while your computer will be usurped by another user to analyze their positions!? This is probably part of the Let's Check function of the program. This is almost unbelievable since there is no way to turn this off. In fact, the only way I have found to turn this off is by turning off my internet connection. Granted, my game appears to be automatically saved but why should someone else use my resources (electric, CPU etc..) to analyze their games, especially when I was using them? Just for this alone, I had to go from 5 stars to 3. And it makes me wonder, what else is the program doing without my permission??",2015-08-19

I have downloaded several freeplay sessions from various games companies and when I download it is the same one card, so I assume even though I tried uninstalling several times, the system is going back to the old installation that is still in my system, even though my pc has been cleaned professionally several times.

1384,US,22856784,RV12BWFL550GO,B00CMSCV4Q,N,Y,My first MMO and I love it,"I have never played any of the previous Final Fantasies before this one. I had watched my brother play one once and I thought the one he had played was so tedious and took forever to get anywhere. I am not entirely sure which one it was but he was playing it on a PS2 back in the day. Seeing him trying to play the game a whole day straight, glued to the screen, determined to get as far as he could which seemed to take For-E-ver, just looked to stressful of a game. So at that time it never caught my interest.<br /><br />Years later I fell in love with the man I am with now, and both him and I play video games on our computers together. Either far apart or when I get to stay over I bring my gaming laptop and we enjoy playing together.<br /><br />He got me into this game. I can honestly say that the graphics on this game are gorgeous and the maps are huge. It took me a long time to memorize and know where i was going. I didnt have a mount when I first started out, so him and i were walking a very very long time, besides teleporting between areas. The story is intriguing and a few parts may cause the tears to jerk. I also have bought the expansion that came out for it this year, though I felt the expansion was lacking  for the amount it cost and it felt rushed. Im hoping there is much more to come and soon because running the same stuff over and over for gear can burn you out at times. So I highly suggest having a few spare games to turn to that will help you from getting burnt out. But the game itself without the expansion, for me was well worth the time and money. Its really a beautiful game and this is my first MMO I have ever played and was blown away by it. Its great to meet people from all over the world, build friendships and just explore.<br /><br />Also another plus in this game is you are able to change classes/jobs There is so much you can do, it feels entirely endless. You are not forced to be stuck with one which is nice. You can also change your race of your character down the road, if you like but you have to buy the magic potion through the mogul site. Though i believe you get one for free with the game and another one with the expansion, I just cant entirely remember. But if those get used up you have to buy more form the main store, which also sells other goodies to glamour your gear or mounts. I feel the game is highly worth checking out.",2015-08-18

I also appreciated the more adult tones‚Äì not &#34;adult&#34; in the sense of sexuality or language, but in the complexity, smartness, and snark that older players can understand more than younger ones. It's great that Her Interactive tries to make games that are not only appropriate for all ages, but appealing to all ages too.<br />As for downsides of this game, I did not like the limited area for exploring. I also felt that the mystery was a bit too straightforward. There were no major twists or surprises, and the conclusion was fairly obvious, at least to me.<br />Gameplay time was on the medium-to-short side.

I noticed it was on sale here so I grabbed it for them and they're happily all playing quietly now on the Xbox 360 and two computers as on Steam you can play online and offline so two kids can play on the same account which is great.<br />Excellent game, I can't wait to see what's next from Bethesda in this series.

It is so simple all you do is use cars to play soccer. What is not simple is actually doing just that. Takes a little bit of time to get used to but once you start playing oh boy. I only play online so I can't comment on the season gameplay. The online play is great except the servers can be problematic. At least three times a week the lag is so awful and everybody's ping is showing green so it is not the users. I don't think the developers expected the game to be as popular as it was. Possibly could be the problem. Since it was the free game on PSPLUS for a while that is what really made it take off. Everybody I know is addicted. My gf wants to crack the disc, she doesn't realize there is no disc, so she is quite confused. Not all of us can be smart.",2015-08-15

This is outrageous. I can download a 5GB movie in 15 minutes, but 7 HOURS for a 7GB game?! Origin is absolutely awful - their servers are a joke; and if you download at a busy time, you'll be waiting days.<br /><br />Oh - and if you want to download the 3 expansion packs, you're adding around 3-5+ additional hours of download time.

There are still dungeons, there are still weekly tome stones, weekly raid lockouts and its primals. If you like that sort of thing at this stage then this MMO is for you! However, my problem with it is simple, it doesn't offer anything new and engaging to keep me interested. I started playing this game when it was a wreck back in 1.0, it became interesting around 1.2 but when ARR launched they simply removed all of those interesting bits that kept me playing through 1.2.

It can be done both before and after the main campaign  with a few unique lines.<br />The area is visually pleasing and is filled with mobs that level with your party (starting at level 20) and can be quite challenging on higher difficulties.<br /><br />The central quest line is done quite well, and enjoyable for the story and dialogue. It is however, not very long. Exploring every nook and cranny of the DLC map gave me 10 hours on nightmare, but that is really pushing the length of the DLC.<br /><br />At a $15 price tag, you certainly would expect more - considering the DA:O and DA2 DLC were priced lower and are longer. EA/Bioware are really getting greedy with these price tags. For the Dragon Age fan, it is probably worth it and more of the game that you like and the new mobs can be a good challenge if you thought the main game was too easy.

So much so that I just rented a private server So I could enjoy it with a few select friends.<br /><br />Now I am a gamer but this is a first for me usually survival games are fun for 20-30 hours I am currently well over 300 hours and the fun really feels like It has just begun. There is just so much to do and thats even on a low pvp server (we don't allow destroying players bases when they are offline)<br /><br />Pros:<br />Wildcard studio - Has constant and meaningful updates, This is one of the few early access games I have played that I believe will be finished and that the end product will be nicer then its current version.<br /><br />The game play is fun by yourself , Though much more entertaining with a friend. Its also easier to survive early game with a strong tribe.<br /><br />I find the graphics nice as is desirable in a current gen game.<br /><br />The thrill of taming a t - rex and ridding it into battle is one of the best in any game ive played. Though they do make you work for it.(knocking out the trex with narco arrows and keeping it fed, alive and knocked out, you have to feed it narco berry's or narcotics for a few hours all while defending it and yourself from other predators.<br /><br />You can ride dinosaurs , fly birds and even swim on a dolphin or sharks back.<br /><br />Building a base is fun My advice is try and find slightly level ground for any base you build.<br /><br />Just so you knows:<br /><br />At first the game is hard as almost anything can kill you at low level and that does not even include the annoying players on heavy pvp servers. (They are not near as bad on this game as say rust or 7 days to Die) After about level 20 with a  few dinosaurs under your belt the game becomes less hard though more frustrating at times.<br /><br />There are public servers, they are a little more lagged as everyone's bases are littering the landscape (you can destroy there base even on pve servers if they have not been active for 12 days and this has helped with the lag spikes) .<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The graphics are not optimized yet though they are getting better weekly. (it takes less and less of a good machine to run it well. With my GTX 750 Ti I can run it smoothly on high settings at roughly 40 fps.

READ AT YOUR RISK!!!!<br /><br />I bought the Digital SAO: Lost Song, getting SAO RE: Hollow Fragment for free on my PS4. I have to say for being a PSP game, upgraded to a PS Vita, then HD mastered and localization corrections, This is like playing FFX/X-2, dated but awesome graphics. Fun game play where you do not have to micro-manage aspect of each character. Don't get me wrong, each level of Aincrad is fairly short but you have 25 more levels to complete plus the Hollow area. I have about 5-7 hours in now and been through Level 76 and the first part of the hollow missions too. It is fun and interacting with all the other characters in thee SAO world is a blast. I admit I was a bit lost in the beginning on what was happening and why certain characters were introduced when you do not meet them until later, after SAO closes in the anime series. But all that gets explained later! Being a SAO fan it got me addicted quickly to explore the remaining 25 levels that the anime did not cover. I am really excited in putting in the time and seeing Kirito grow to level 200, You start at level 100 and a boat load of skills and the weapons form the anime. You learn fast and it is not so bad to grind out with your NPC partner. They will advise you when they want to tank it out, perform a combo special strike, or stun the enemy so they can perform their special, or cast buffs. The NPC Partner AI is fairly intelligent but you have to watch, if your partner dies the game will end. And remember, you are still in SAO, SAO lure means if you die in game, you die in real life, so they keep the continuity of the anime. The biggest pitfall but best feature is you can not manually save the game but the game will auto-save everytime you move in and out of areas. But you get in trouble half way through the area and die, you have to start all over form the beginning of the area.<br /><br />P.S. The other really cool continuity feature in the game is the &#34;LOGOUT&#34; option is grayed out and although you can highlight, you can not select it. You have to hit your PS button to go to your dashboard and close the application...is the &#34;LOGOUT&#34; option is grayed out and although you can highlight, you can not select it.

That being said, it gives you the chance to play the game during development, and ARK is very playable and the developers are exceptionally communicative and responsive to bug reports and deliver new content constantly.<br /><br />ARK is a survival/crafting game with large worlds populated by many other players and by dinosaurs you can tame or fight. You can (must) farm, hunt, build, and provide security for yourself and any tamed creatures you might have. The real frustration with this game is that in PVP servers, anything you've built, tamed, or gathered can be destroyed while you're logged out. Most &#34;PVP&#34; is other people effectively murdering you in your sleep. If you find a large group (over 20) you can have a tribe that might be able to help you hold onto your things while you're not playing.<br /><br />Beyond other people, the only real problems are that the game is pretty resource intensive. It actually runs very well for being so beautiful, having changeable/created environments, and so many other players, but it will still require a lot of power to run well.",2015-08-13

1816,US,21767922,R35O3GV3HZUX8B,B013TVXHYC,N,N,more than my moneys worth,"This is definitely a game to keep your eye on<br /><br />Now, keep in mind that this game is in early access, so buy it at this stage has its risks as the final product may not be as good as the hype demanded, this is the same for all preorders and early access games, just know that by buying this, you are committing to something that isn't even done yet.<br /><br />so onto the review.<br />You start the game off customizing your character with a viable range of customization options, it is unlikely that you will find another player that will look exactly like you do. naked and on the beach on one of 12 locations along the shore, from this point you have to collect resources in order to progress and survive, this is where the game is similar to games such as rust, day z etc.<br />Where the game takes its originality is in the wildlife on the island, as you can probably tell, it is populated by dinosaurs and the such.<br />Each creature has its role in the delicate ecosystem of the island, ranging from the dodo, a good source of easy meat, to the T Rex, as one of the many apex predators that will try to eat you. Taming or killing certain creatures will unlock a Dossier for your account which only needs to be unlocked once, this gives you useful information about the uses of the creature, as well as some backstory on it, which is always nice to read, as the artwork is top quality for what it is.<br />As you level up, you are given a choice of what aspect of your character you can improve, be it, movement speed, melee damage, crafting speed, health, defence etc, and once you level up, you are given a choice of which recipe to unlock for your character based on how many points you have, as you level you receive more points to put towards more expensive recipes, however it is difficult to procure the essentials early, so are may have to rely on a friend to craft the things that you cannot. Otherwise some recipes can be found at random drops throughout the island, the drops are colour coordinated to show which level you would need to be in order to access it.<br /><br />One of the areas that the game falls short on AT THIS MOMENT is the amount of grinding that needs to be performed in order to create better equipment. You may find yourself spending hours just collecting resources just to create one item, however resource collecting is made much easier by riding on specific dinos and using them to collect them for you, with the addition of more dinos coming to ease the challenge of creating some of the more grindy materials. And I might add that riding these creature feels very fluid and satisfactory, whether it be running through the woods on a raptor, soaring the sky on a pteranodon, or swimming in the ocean on a Megalodon. However one of the more annoying parts of the game is taming theses creatures. As their level increases, so does the time it takes to tame them, for example, a high level Brontosaurus can take up to 8 hours and more depending on how you tame it. The developers have added ways to reduce this time though, with the addition of prime meat, taming carnivores is much easier, and by using specific kibble on certain dinos, this time can be reduced further. Creating a server give the creator a large range of options to customise the server experience, let it be reducing the time to tame, exp gained, resistance to damage or even the day and night cycle, the options are really left to you! Though I will give you a fair warning, this is not the kind of game that you can play for only half an hour.<br />Your character does not need to remain on a single server, if you choose, you can upload your character, your dinos and your items to a database, which you can download on servers that allow it.<br /><br />It is clear that the developers care about the game and its player base, they listen to suggestions and celebrate creativeness, they are certainly people i feel glad that I gave my money to.<br />If you still aren't convinced on the game, i suggest you watch streamers play the game, so that you can get an firm grasp of what you may be buying. [...]<br /><br />If i was to do a Dollar per hour to tell you how much its worth, for me at the moment, it would be worth $164<br /><br />Review update:<br />since i wrote this review initially, Ark has updates many times, at least once a week with a major update at least once a month.<br />since my review, ark has added the many new features, including but not limited to: dino breeding, new biomes such as the swamp biome and the snow biome.

For the survivor on the move, platform saddles have been added, allowing you to build a mobile base on some of your larger pets.<br />for those who dont like the idea of using modern tools in a dinosaur survival game, there are servers designed to keep you in the stone age, you can live out your fantasy of being a cave man.<br />The game has also been added to the Xbox One, so for those wondering, the game is available (still in early access) for pc on steam or on the Xbox one.

I was skeptical when I learned that the game wouldn't have the traditional point-and-click interface to move the character around (instead, the player has direct control of the character's movement with the analog stick).  But after playing the game, I admit this was definitely the way to go.  Because the player controls Graham's movements directly, I recommend using a controller instead of the mouse-and-keyboard method.  I'm playing the PlayStation 4 version.  I played through the first chapter twice and am eagerly awaiting the release of the next chapter.  The voice acting and story are great, and there is a lot of humor.

With that in mind yes the game does have issues here and there, but the dev team is very active and interactive with the users. They are constantly rolling out patches to not only fix existing issues, but also constantly adding new content. Just keep in mind that due to it still being under development, it also goes through the occasional server wipe, so don't be surprised if you log on one day and everything is gone. So far though you are allowed to keep your level.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this game. SUPER fun! Many options to adjust it however you'd like (in terms of health, damage, hunger, thirst, stamina), I personally turned stamina off because I get tired of being tired.

Sometimes you might fall through the map and die (this is v.rare and can usually be avoided). Bought this because you can ride dinosaurs and build huts and shoot other people. Some parts are time consuming but if you join a tribe(team/clan) things become easier. You can still play single if you're smart about the game play.<br /><br />The updates come very frequently. At least once a month you get new dino or features added.

It really helps to create a better looking game and optimizes the game for the PC better.<br />While the community is generally good, this game is not cheater-free, as I've experienced the console version and the second game on PC to be (or at least much closer).<br /><br />At any rate, this is a long, skill-based, action RPG, with many, many secrets, styles of play, and items to discover. There isn't much of a narrative, but the world itself manages to tell a story of a place fallen into hopelessness and madness. The game is pretty much exclusively about combat: observing enemy behaviors, utilizing the right equipment, learning from your mistakes, finding shortcuts and patience are all key skills to cultivate for success in Dark Souls.<br /><br />While this isn't the smoothest port (hence the one-star knocked off), the art direction is great, the level design is mostly brilliant and brilliantly interconnected, music is top-notch, and the amount of things to do (cooperate to take down bosses; harass other players, upgrade your equipment; find all weapons and spells; max your attributes through multiple playthroughs that always ensure every encounter demands your attention) make this a great addition to your PC library if you have the time and patience.

And while Wilhelm may just seem like a polished and recycled Axton / Mordecai lovechild, the story, easter eggs, character dialogue and butt slamming more than make up for it.<br /><br />PS.

Lost Souls is tailored for a much younger game player between 10 and 13 years old I would guess.

The only difference is GGE caters to the stereotypical Frat Boy with big 'sposions, potty humor and ridiculous voice overs -- imagine Duke Nukem narrating your face.  You get the idea.<br /><br />It begins like most racers - you're the new driver and you need to work your way up the ranks by winning races.  It's pretty straightforward stuff.  To help you along the way, you can upgrade your car with all manner of guns and pick up powerups along the race tracks.  Like I said, if you've played any of the games mentioned at the beginning of this review, you'll know what to expect.  There are several game modes including power races, knockout races, eliminator races and even team deathmatch.  It's all perfectly fun even though the AI is ridiculously adept at driving and you will struggle to win a lot of races.  I'm not saying I want it to be easy, but there are some races I simply cannot win no matter what I do.  I can pick up every boost, every mine, ever mine/grenade and still lose by five seconds.  Kind of frustrating.<br /><br />You'll be racing opponents with names like Jed I. Knight, Luke Likesheet, Perry Noid and Alotta Fagina (this game isn't for youngsters, unless you feel compelled to explain what those names mean if your child asks).<br /><br />The struggles I had with this game is that it runs very poorly for me.  When I launch it, the game switches Windows to &#34;Basic.&#34;  The races take an EXTREMELY long time to load - I'm talking 60-90 seconds or longer and that's if they load at all.  I've had to bring up the Task Manager on many occasions to force quit the game because it's not responding.<br /><br />If you can get past some of the technical limitations, it's good for a laugh or two.

I personally like not having to use the official guide to solve a puzzle because I find it unclear and impossible.<br /><br />I had a bit of a hard time downloading this game because it was hard to figure out HOW to do it.  The Mac version games are easier to download than the PC games since you have to download their Amazon Games & Software Downloader Application that allows you to actually download the game.  For me it did not take hours.  It just depends on your wifi.  Maybe an hour and then 20 minutes to install.  So it was a little hard to open the Amazon game and also make sure your PC says it is ONLINE and verified where online game purchases are (amazon game center?  It tells you where to go to download once you buy).<br /><br />AND NOTE:  (SPOILER)<br /><br />If you cannot pick something up in the closet its because you FIRST have to turn on the light so Nancy can see.<br /><br />All together a fun game in my book.  Though yes I missed talking to Bess. So if you have a love for all games by Her Interactive it's worth it and the download you should do if you think you can figure out how to download and open the Amazon Software Downloader since it was a bit difficult to find out why it wouldnt open and start.  Then once set up it shouldnt be too long to download depending on your internets speed.",2015-08-11

After a day or two you get an in-game email from the bank saying that they would gladly lone you $100,000 dollars usually enough to purchase 1 truck. However, once you have borrowed money from the bank you owe interest once daily that's, depending on how much money you have borrowed, the amount that you pay daily varies. After that you can unlock $400,000 loans with an even bigger interest rate. After that it's pretty much up to you. You can wreck your truck and pay thousands of dollars in repair.

I have Windows 7 ultimate 64 bit, if that matters. I should also mention that when downloading, you need to walk away from the computer until it downloads completely. I did other things the first time while downloading and ended up with a corrupt version. Then I tried again but walked away until the download was complete and it was all good.  First to install it and get it working initially, I set my system time back to 2010 for EFLC and Dec 2008 for GTA IV. It's August now. After it's installed, the 'Release Date check should work. If did for me. After it's installed and all good, you can set your date back to real time.  Next to get it working because the game won't start because of Window games something or other. You have to get xLiveLess and copy the xlive.dll into the GTA IV or EFLC folder. Now the game will start. Link is here; http://www.gta4-mods.com/tools/xliveless-097b-f2408  Another annoying thing is the loading screens at startup every time you play. You can disable them using this method but you also need to have ScriptHook.dll installed for it to work. Links for both; http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2000065 http://www.gta4-mods.com/tools/gta-iv-net-scripthook-v0893-beta-f2941  Finally, this is the best site for mods and other scripts and things that don't give you bs popups when downloading. www.gta4-mods.com.  You also don't want to use gtainside.com because you'll get those popups saying you have a virus and then you have a hard time closing out the windows.  Hope this helped someone and you get to enjoy the game too. Have fun",2015-08-10

Anyway, this game is simply good addictive fun that ends up taking over your life, lol. Soccer played in rocket powered cars/vans. Laughably simple idea executed to perfection. It features offline seasons and exhibitions so you can play by yourself against bots (not sure if there is local co-op or not) as well as a full tutorial broken down into sections to teach the basic mechanics of the game. However, online matches are definitely the way to go. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 (ranked matches dont include the 4v4 chaos though). You have basic mathces and ranked matches. Ranked matches are a little more tricky because when somebody quits (and somebody always ends up quitting at some point), the match doesnt autopopulate with anybody queued to play or with bots, so your teams can end up unbalanced. Of course, the flip side of this is that when you win a 1 or 2 on 3 match, it is especially sweet! Speaking of autopopulating, that's what happens in non ranked matches as people quit. It just fills the void, either with another player or, if another player isnt available for whatever reason, it fills the blanks with bots.<br /><br />So, thems the basics. There is turbo boost, acquired by running over little turbo buffs located at specific spots in the arena (they are always at the same spots, and reset after like 15 seconds), which fills your counter part way (except for 6 100% boost buffs located on the axis points). You can use the boost to literally fly, drive on the walls, and for a little while, even on the ceiling, giving this game a 360 degree 3D aspect to it. Anything can potentially happen at anytime, and the matches are often chaotic as can be. That said, when a team gels, it is something to behold. Which leads me to another aspect.....team building. Via invites, you can make sure that you and up to 3 of your friends can play on the same teams for every match, giving you the ability to develop in game strategies, made even easier if everybody uses headsets.<br /><br />Anyway, that is a quick summation of this game. Once you play, you will likely want to keep on playing for a while. It is just some of the best fun to be had out there.up to 3 of your friends can play on the same teams for every match, giving you the ability to develop in game strategies, made even easier if everybody uses headsets.<br /><br />Anyway, that is a quick summation of this game.

2267,US,50904666,R274A57HFI8PF4,B00Y5P7AX6,N,N,One of the best games I've played and it's still in Early Access (Beta),"This is one of the best games I've played in a while and it's early access! I got hooked on this game hard. The graphics, sound, abilities, combat, inventory management all fantastic. The upgrade system for enhancing your gear allows for a lot of variety. I explored every inch of every map, hacking away at the endless relentless hordes of evil that plague the beautiful and varied landscapes. You start in zombie infested swamplands. Then you unlock the other side of town and it's like something out of the wild west. There is strong variety in enemy design.<br /><br />The ability to open rifts (teleports) anywhere in the game is a dream come true for inventory management. You don't have to make tough decisions about what to carry. Just teleport back to town, sell stuff, and return to where you were. Monsters don't respawn from teleporting. This also makes tough boss battles easier. Sometimes I would die repeatedly to a boss, but a rift in that room let me return back to it quickly. Another great feature is that enemies don't regenerate health, so you can eventually whittle down even the toughest challenges.<br /><br />A few downsides are that the grind can get tiresome due to the extreme amount of enemies standing in your way. They don't respawn unless you exit the game, however, which is nice for keeping track of where you've been as the maps are enormous.<br /><br />You can't save the game, which makes it hard to play shorter sessions. If you start exploring a map, you're in for the long haul until you either clear the entire area or find a new rift. Otherwise, the next time you log in you start at the city and all the monsters you cleared on a map have respawned. Exiting the game removes any existing personal rift you left behind also, so no quick teleporting to where you left off on a map. This was the most frustrating feature for me, because I can't always play for hours at a time and would have to play something else when my play time was shorter.<br /><br />Sale prices of items to shops is really low. Buy prices are really high. It needs better balance. It's not that huge of a deal, since the best items keep flowing from combat loot and treasure chests.<br /><br />I also felt we don't get enough points to boost our skills each level. The game boasts combining two classes but it takes around 40 skill points just to cap out tier 1 abilities in one class. You only get 3 points per level. So you have to sacrifice boosting your main class just to scratch the surface of the second class.<br /><br />I pointed out a handful of downsides, but it is early access. It's in incredible shape for an EA title, most of which we all know aren't that well off. I highly recommend supporting the game. I played 42 hours before I ran of content as of May 4. New content is coming soon according to the developer notes. In the meanwhile I started playing Titan Quest, an older game from the same creator. I just can't get enough!e prices of items to shops is really low. Buy prices are really high. It needs better balance.

The graphics weren't too taxing on my computer nor too basic either. The price was low and it has different game modes for whatever you're in the mood for. But there is a major case of micro managing that ruined the game.<br /><br />Basically, when you get your villagers to start gathering resources, that's only part of the job. For example, when you have them collecting wood for you, you'll see an icon above that building of wood. Each time he collects wood, there's that floating icon above the building. If you don't click on that icon, the wood is gone and you don't get it. So basically, even if you have a guy collecting wood, you still have to keep repeatedly collecting it yourself throughout the game. It's the same way with stone, wheat, ground flour, food, and taxes among other things. So even though you set up a system of income and resource-gathering, you still have to constantly click on the floating icons or else lose those resources.<br /><br />So I gotta ask what the point even is of erecting all these buildings and going to all the trouble of getting villagers to collect resources when you yourself basically have to constantly collect the resources anyway? I'll be trying to read and understand missions and trying to build new buildings, plus defend my settlement against thieves, but I can't because I have to keep clicking the stupid icons or I'll not get the resources I need to build the buildings in the first place.<br /><br />Understand now why I only gave it two stars? That one simple decision the game developers made for players to have to click on and collect resources constantly was enough to keep the game from being fun at all. I like keeping track of how all my workers and buildings are doing, but this is beyond micro managing everything. This is my having to DO everything, which makes all the buildings and workers useless.<br /><br />If it wasn't for that, I really would have loved this game.",2015-08-08

My one star review is based on THIS VERSION of the game, the Amazon version.<br /><br />If you have a modern operating system like Windows 10, this game will not work. But it went beyond not working. It took a long time to download and when it finally finished, the installation was a major pain. First off, you can't play it without updating it, but I couldn't update since the update is through Ubisoft's servers and my employer's internet doesn't allow for anything video game related,I had to wait until I got home to my other computer. But then that's when it got bad. After again downloading a long while and installing and updating, I looked and the game wasn't anywhere in the start menu or even in a &#34;program files folder&#34;. I did searches on the computer for the game and it couldn't locate the game. The only place I could find it was in the list of programs I could uninstall. So it won't ever complete the installation apparent, at least not on Windows 10.<br /><br />Basically this version of the game will not and does not work with Windows 10. It would hog up all my computer's memory so i couldn't do anything else while I waited, and it froze the computer up a few times. And not once did I ever even get a chance to play the game.<br /><br />But then on my home computer, I found out Steam has the game. I never liked game launchers but Steam won me over today. Their version of the game not only downloaded faster, but installed faster, and I could still do other computer stuff while I waited. Plus it was the same price. Sorry to Amazaon but if you have a modern operating system, then get the Steam version, not this Amazon one. I wasted my money with the Amazon version. Maybe if I still had Vista it would have worked, but I didn't and it didn't. I wasted ten dollars and half my day when I should have gone to Steam first.",2015-08-08

The only problem with most point and click games is that it's all about figuring out how to do things. Once you solve all the puzzles and watched the whole storyline, that's it. What I mean is you can't exactly come back to the game a year later, because you already know how to solve all the puzzles and already know the storyline, so there's no suprises or anything new. So games like this are really only good one time through, but at least Jack Keane made that one time through really fun.<br /><br />Oh, and one issue I did have is that the game randomly crashes for me. I don't know why. I've run it in compatability modes but the game still crashes. I think it's a bit too old for modern operating systems. BUT it didn't crash very often. I just saved my game often and it wasn't so bad.",2015-08-08

I can understand it early on in the game so the player gets an understanding of the basics of the game, but to get the same mission over and over and over again got boring fast. Variation would have kept me playing the game. Now I can't go back to it. I've filled my quote of building huts for this year.",2015-08-08

I have spent over a month and a half playing amateur software engineer and internet sleuth on Rockstars support forums & have still not been able fully download & launch Grand Theft Auto V. Rockstar Social Club is an absolutely and completely broken service & with out its function GTA V can not be installed. The Social Club launcher runs at about a tenth of my internet speed yet somehow completely prohibits any other internet use for any and all devices on my network. The social club launcher loses its connection to the download servers at least once per 5 minute interval and along with this loss of connection goes any download progress accumulated since the last loss of server connection.

Because PlayStation Plus is probably one of the best decisions Sony has made in their entire career. Why is this subscription so great? I'll tell you why.<br /><br />PlayStation Plus is an amazing service because of all of the advantages it gives you over normal PSN users. By far the main advantage, and the most publicized, is how PlayStation Network offers you a specific game for free, almost every week. Not just that, but the vast majority of these games are recent games that came out within the past 18 months, and nearly every game that is free thanks to this program has received good reviews overall from critics.<br /><br />Here are some notable examples of games that PlayStation Plus has given for free as past offers<br />*Uncharted 3<br />*LittleBigPlanet2<br />*Infamous 2<br />*Metro Last Light<br />*BioShock Infinite<br />*Super Street Fighter 4<br />*Grid 2<br />*Scott Pilgrim...

I bought this during the steam summer sales for around $5 (You'd probably want to do the same if you are planning on playing this for the PC) so I have nothing much to complain about but the game is packaged like this:<br /><br />- One short 2 hour mission. With every question answered more crop up! (I've only played part of MGS IV and no other games in the franchise besides watching gameplay on MGS and MG)<br />- Side missions are on the same map at different times of the day with different objectives: Eliminate certain targets, bring certain targets to extraction, fetch quests, blow up certain objectives etc.<br />- Extras include some soundtrack and &#34;cassette tape&#34; collectables found throughout the game.<br /><br />The main mission was well executed but it's really only a quarter of a taste of what Phantom Pains will be (in case you haven't seen the trailer which looks badass). You get one main solo mission with Ground Zeroes and side mission also solo.<br /><br />If you want to play MGS V just wait for Phantom Pain (On Steam Ground Zeroes is packaged with it for the price of a single game) or try to get Ground Zeroes for a sale price. Not a whole lot of replay value for me (Different difficulty settings + rewards for finishing missions with certain scores/grades. The rewards are something like special weapons you can begin with next time you replay the same mission).<br /><br />Stealth is definitely an essential (mostly in Hard mode, normal mode is not exactly a run and gun experience as stealth plays a huge role) but the stealth choices are limited. You can crawl in grass/vents/under objects like tankers which seems to be the most effective for getting places. No iconic cardboard box for Snake either. One of the missions was letting it on but... no. Maybe I'm not used to MGS games but the level is pretty redundant since cover is mostly always placed at crouch height.<br /><br />Overall 3/5 experience for me since I was a bit disappointed the first mission almost let on that we were going to get more main missions afterwards. My fault for not reading/watching reviews and jumping the gun on the purchase. Please don't judge me as a seasoned MGS player as most of you are but as a newcomer!

I bought it the other day and start to finish took me exactly 5 hours.  I enjoyed the gameplay overall, but some of the platforming tends a bit away from tricky towards annoying.  The fight mechanics are fun and are unlocked as you progress through the storyline.  Because it's so short, however, you barely have time to get comfortable with one new move before another is introduced.  My main gripe with the game is that it included locked on disc DLC.  What I mean is that there are areas located and visible on the in game map that must be purchased SEPARATELY from the main game. I thought that beating the final boss would unlock them but alas, they cost an extra few dollars.  Not a fan when developers do this in general, but especially not when the game is so short that it almost necessitates an extra purchase to get the full experience.",2015-08-06

I was hesitant because I did not get in to Witcher 2- it was way too linear and straight forward.  Witcher 3 is a total 180 from that.  Very rich, realistic world.  If you like any RPGs, you gotta try this one!  Great character personality development and detail, intricate (almost too much so) plot, good leveling system.  I like Elder Scrolls type open world games where I can roam, this is the most important aspect of a good RPG to me...  Witcher 3 has all the joy of doing that, except everything is not leveled to you, so you will occasionally get ravaged by much higher level monsters.  However, you will find lots of entertaining side quests, so don't skip out on the exploration aspect of this game.<br />The only thing some people may not like is the pace of this game.  It is occasionally slow.  Don't let this bother you.  Just get used to the slower pace.  Actually read the notice boards, go through all the dialogue choices and actually listen to them, do the side quests.  Read the bestiary and actually plan for the next beast slaying.  Pretend you're reading a book and just enjoy the world of Witcher 3.  You won't regret it.",2015-08-05

Lovecraft thrown in for good measure? Then this might be what you are looking for!<br /><br />First, let me talk about the graphics! The graphics are gorgeous! Right from the start when you find yourself standing on the train tracks at the end of a tunnel, surrounded by a dense woodland area. It's probably one of the most beautiful games I have played. In fact you might spend more time wandering around the game world, looking at the scenery than you do solving mysteries. In my 8+ hours of playtime I spent 2 hours of it just looking out over oceans and frolicing around in the woods.<br /><br />In terms of gameplay, the game starts off telling you that it's not going to hold your hand, which it doesn't. this is a double edged sword in my opinion. On one hand, you don't have some clumsy UI detracting from the immersion of the game. On the other hand, the games definition of &#34;Hand holding&#34; apparently includes: Explaining controls, explaining your abilities, explaining why you are wherever it is you are, letting you manually save and letting you view an inventory(or notebook system....or map). So, in the end it's kind of cool thatyou have a nice clean screen to enjoy the visuals of the game, but that also means that if you quit playing for a few days and forget what you have collected, or what you were trying to do, yer pretty much up a creek without a paddle.<br /><br />-Pros-<br />Beautiful graphics.<br />Challenging yet logical puzzles(mostly)<br />H.P.

I chose this expansion over the supernatural one because well who doesn't want to ride horses?<br />I have had the game over a month and have loved playing it. You get to own cats, dogs, turtles and horses. So far the horses are like having more family members. I have even had a couple colts. I find the game play a little hard due to the space issue. They complain a lot about things in the way and nothing is there. I think with this expansion they should have allowed you to enlarge your land to fit having horses and all they require.<br />You will have to look online to figure out how to advance at times. Like if you have a foal and it matures to rideable age you still can't ride him. You have to befriend him/her then start training to get to ride them. No where in the game does it hint at this. I guess this is something you just have to figure out. I am enjoying the game as a whole but wish you fun in figuring out some of it.

After setting up all the options, I jump into a quick race to try the game out. Right away, I sense a problem with using my Xbox Controller for Windows (works perfect with the F1 2013 version), the upper left mini-joystick does control steering & I can also change views, but the car will not move forward. I double checked my control settings again (and again) and still, cannot get the car to accelerate at all (gearbox : automatic). I tried out the Direct Input setting, with a Logitech joystick, still no joy. Even selecting the keyboard setting has no effect at car acceleration. I re-checked my control hardware in a couple other games, and they function perfectly well.

And there is multiplayer to so you can play with your<br />friend or brother then it will be much faster to finish the mission that your stuck on and when you do multiplayer there is  another person who looks like you but he is silver. there are some interesting characters and 2 people are evil and was on your side then he turns evil and when he was on our side his robots attacked us and he has big robots and knack can be as big as them he can even be taller then them.,2015-08-04

2824,US,35597518,RPUXGZHH0IPW0,B010O9XWO2,N,N,Expecting more from King's Quest,"Great game so far. I've played the original games in the 1980s and early 90s, and now this. I love the way the story is going so far, the voice acting is wonderful, and the game is beautiful. I love the action sequences. I really enjoy how it breaks up the adventuring, but I feel the controls could be better. I'm playing on a fast PC with an XBOX One controller. When jumping from rock to rock during the dragon fire sequence, it felt like a struggle, especially when trying to go on a diagonal. While the game is beautful -- and I understand how it's meant to look like a cartoon, the game does nothing to push modern graphics hardware. My GTX 770 barely heats up. I doubt this game would even challenge older consoles. There could be more movement in the backgrounds which almost seem static at times. While there are some particles floating around in some screens, there could be more... a lot more detail everywhere. This is especially noticiable after just getting done playing the 2013 reboot of Tombraider. I know, different game, different design, but I was expecting more. I would love for the player to be able to control the camera so we could see more of these beautiful scenes in every direction. King's Quest IV has always been my favorite. One of the things that made IV so great, was the music (as heard on the Roland MT-32). Composer William Goldstein really hit it out of the park with that soundtrack. So much so, that 27 years later, the melodies are still stuck in my head. The music is very well done in this new game, but I feel it lacks melodies that would really make it a hit. Overall, wonderful game, but was expecting just a bit more in the graphics and music department from a title that previously set the course for computer gaming more than 30 years ago.",2015-08-04

I think people are forgetting some of the more difficult and frustrating parts of the original games. Remember falling into a lake and drowning immediately, or trying to climb the beanstalk without falling? So far, the rest of the negative reviews seem to be from people who can't get the game to run, which is more of an issue with Steam than with the game.<br /><br />OK, that's out of the way. What makes this game great? Primarily, it really captures the spirit and humor of the old games. The game is also much more story driven and cerebral than most other games you'll see released today. Although (so far. at least) the puzzles seem to be lacking in true complexity and the game is more linear than the originals, it's a truly enjoyable experience and I have high hopes for the remaining chapters.

2938,US,452646,R3T488J5GWVIHF,B00GA6GJBC,N,N,Buggy - should have been more fun,"Monster Trucks should be all about fun. They are massive, over-powered and over-sized vehicles let loose on tracks to perform stunts and cause some solid carnage. A title called Monster Truck Destruction should be about as entertaining as a game comes, but it is held back by limited options and game depth that fail to take a fun premise as far as it could have gone.<br /><br />The biggest problem for Monster Truck Destruction is that it is about as straight of a port as you will probably ever see. There have been plenty of mobile games that have made the transition from you pocket to the PC monitor, but Monster Truck Destruction feels like one of the laziest attempts I have seen to date.<br /><br />The problems start with the options, of which there are very few. Low and high graphics, neither one of which feels like it has really seen a notable uptick from its mobile counterpart. The controls are incredibly basic, with touch/tap in mind. Here you will be using a mouse and keyboard instead - with controller support sadly lacking and creating something of a missed opportunity to take advantage of the game's arcade feel. It claims full controller support, but I have no idea what kind of controller the team was using. I have a PC one, an Xbox certified one and a PlayStation 3 controller (that I use with a remapping program for the inputs) and none of them works properly. The Xbox one allowed me to surf the menu options, but that was pretty much it.<br /><br />The other issue is the relatively shallow depth of the game itself. Like most racing games, you start off with a bit of money and pick your vehicle to start with. As you earn money from participating in events, you earn opportunities to become the champion in two different divisions while navigating a race mode and a stunt/destruction mode. Of the two, I found the latter mode more entertaining, but both took good advantage of the bouncy physics in bringing these behemoth vehicles to life.<br /><br />With your money you can purchase new trucks and make suitable upgrades as you attempt to progress further in the circuits. I appreciated options for buying and upgrading vehicles, but the costs for doing so are astronomical. In theory that is fine as you will be coming back for more, but with so little variety in the core gameplay, Monster Truck Destruction becomes an exercise in grinding.<br /><br />The soundtracks released with the game are appropriately blasted metal tunes, but with only a handful of different tracks, they can become pretty repetitive as you repeat your races. The racing controls themselves feel fine, though they take some time and patience to get a feel for. That makes sense to me, given the size of these trucks - why would they feel like a race car? That said, reverse does not appear to work at all.<br /><br />Monster Truck Destruction is a disappointingly bare bones mobile port that really does not do anything to justify its price tag (especially when one considers that the mobile game is free). With some more polish on the control side of things and more depth to the types of events you could partake in, Monster Truck Destruction would at least offer up some simple, serviceable fun. Unfortunately the end product is too rough for its own good and difficult to recommend at this time.y you can purchase new trucks and make suitable upgrades as you attempt to progress further in the circuits.

This game has potential and the graphics aren't bad. It took me a little while to get use to moving around the screen... again things are not clear in the tutorial. The tutorial doesn't teach you how to move around, buy and place things. It doesn't show you how to hire people, set footprints for them etc. etc. There's some text with some tasks instead of a cursor that actually shows you where to find things and how to do things. It's only because I'm use to playing this type of game that I was able to play at all. I couldn't add pathways and I could only spray cobbled road on the grass. I prefer to have things lined up nice and neat instead of just thrown around, scattered, facing the wrong way and not having the people stick to pathways.

2949,US,452646,R35DG0CZN0IAHM,B00ZUN3YH8,N,N,"Fun, if flawed.","Some people seem surprised that the point and click adventure genre has been seeing something of a resurgence over the last couple of years. Those people clearly have not been paying attention to Daedalic Entertainment's offerings, because their titles are almost always excellent, with unique visual styles, compelling stories and simple, yet approachable mechanics that are often geared towards a specific audience. Anna's Quest fits right in.<br /><br />This is in every way a classically styled point and click adventure game. You will have to inspect your surroundings, try to solve puzzles and perhaps most interestingly, leverage Anna's new-found telekinetic powers to help progress as well. The story starts off with a simple, almost sad tale about Anna as she attempts to find a cure for her beloved grandfather's illness. Anna has been something of a shut-in for most of her life however, and runs afoul of a witch that performs some experiments on her. The end result? Anna now has telekinetic powers.<br /><br />It is a strange story to be sure, but one that is well crafted around a wide variety of fairy tales that get interwoven together to create a story with plenty of dark humor. The cast of characters is often charming, and they help to support what might seem like a silly tale with motivations and challenges aplenty.<br /><br />Daedalic Entertainment sports some of the best visual designers in the business, and Anna's Quest benefits from their talents here as well. Characters have gorgeous design, with environments that are both detailed and full of color. The characters are simple at a glance, but charming in their own way with enough facial variety to keep them from feeling like cookie cutter clones. The visual presentation is assisted by some pleasant music and very solid voice acting.<br /><br />While the telekinetic aspect puts a different spin on some of the problem solving, some of the game's mechanics do hold Anna's Quest back slightly. The combining of items is almost always a welcome feature in a game like this, but it leads to some backtracking in the environments when you stumble onto a new puzzle, padding the game a bit in the process. Some of the puzzles are more obscure than I would have liked as well, with the characters providing little or no help when you interact with them.<br /><br />To their credit, the puzzles feel like a part of the world and do a great job of generally feeling organic and the majority of them are clever. They provide the necessary sense of satisfaction that comes from solving the environmental riddles. There are only a handful of these more frustrating ones that hurt the pacing and frustrate when they pop up. They are worth noting, but these puzzles are not frequent enough to really discourage someone from completing the game.<br /><br />Anna's Quest exudes charm with its quirky sense of humor, adorable visuals and quality voice acting. The end result? A memorable story - which is a must for games of this type to succeed. Point and click adventures are still alive and well, at least when Daedalic Entertainment makes them. This is a genre that still holds a warm place in my heart and Anna's Quest is an enjoyable addition to the genre.ms is almost always a welcome feature in a game like this, but it leads to some backtracking in the environments when you stumble onto a new puzzle, padding the game a bit in the process.

2982,US,452646,R9TVF1I7DOI2Q,B010R8DUFQ,N,N,Just a lot of fun,"Sometimes there are games that rope you in due to an incredibly deep, twisting narrative. Other titles use photo-realistic graphics or movie actors in their voice cast to breathe life into their creations. There are a variety of hooks that development teams use to try and draw players in, but quite often the most effective is simply making a game that is a ton of fun to play. Rocket League fits that description perfectly.<br /><br />The idea is ridiculous, but so highly entertaining. Take the sport of soccer, but instead of using players, go ahead and use racing cars instead. They can jump, flip, burst forward with incredible speed as the teams slam into one another while trying to guide the oversized ball into the other team's goal while keeping it out of their own net. The premise is very simple, but also very fun.<br /><br />There are multiple reasons why the formula for Rocket League works so well. For one, the game is highly approachable. The tutorial only takes a few minutes but you can figure out the basic controls and start zipping around the arena in no time. White traditional soccer games tend to be slower paced affairs in the video game world, Rocket League is a brisk game that is frequently carrying out its action at a breakneck pace.<br /><br />Because these are cars and not people, the movement and momentum are what makes the experience a unique one. Flying forward in a straight line is simple enough, but the arcade-like physics can be highly unpredictable when cars have to veer and start powersliding around the arena. Straight line movement is fast, but lateral movement is basically non-existent. You can turn, but there is a turn radius. The cars are fast, but not easy to aim. Adding to the mayhem is the bounciness of the ball. The arena is also closed off, giving you and the ball walls to bounce off of or race around. My absolute favorite highlight was an instance where the ball was about to strike the wall. I zipped up onto it, boosted and then jumped, striking the ball and changing its trajectory before it could reach the wall itself. That quick change forced it to veer off in a new direction - that happened to land in the opposing team's goal. I wish I could say it was skill that drove me to that particular highlight, but if I'm being honest here, it was more likely 90% luck - but I'll still take it.<br /><br />While the controls are simple enough to learn, there is a depth to the mechanics that is not immediately apparent. You start to learn how to read where the ball is bouncing, how to time your jumps better and the best moments to leverage your boost charge. The first time I made an actual save on goal, the ball was hit by one of the enemy AI around midfield, and it was rolling towards our goal. I had a full compliment of boost at my disposal, so even though I was on the wrong half of the field, I just sped for all I was worth towards my goal. Just as my boost ran out, I hit the powerslide and clipped the edge of the ball - pushing it just out of the way of the goal where it bounced off of the nearby wall instead. These moments are an absolute rush, because while the potential for those memorable plays are almost always there, the chaos of the game means that they do not happen very often.<br /><br />Matches are relatively short five minute affairs. My first night playing the game, I unlocked exactly 50% of the trophies and finished a season (albeit the shortest season option that could be selected). Rocket League is a game that begs to be played with other human players. The AI is not bad, but Parker and I were talking about this the other day and we both agreed that the AI is built in a way that allows them to interact with one another - but not necessarily with players. Computer opponents seem more adept at passing the ball and setting up actual organized shots. Parker and I could both recount stories where we were performing what seemed like logical actions, such as streaking unimpeded down the middle or the opposite side of our teammate, but the AI teammate did not seem to register we were there and move the ball to us for what should have been an easy score.<br /><br />Clearly the AI has that capability, because we had both seen it perform plays like that against us when all three opposing cars were computer controlled - yet the teammate AI seems to struggle somewhat with human companions. Playing with friends however, encourages you to communicate and work as a team (or to give you some bragging rights when you best them).<br /><br />Even with such a fun core game, it was great to see Rocket League providing other hooks as well. There are plenty of unlockable items that can make your cars look as cool or ridiculous as you would like. Want a sharp paint job? Sure - apply a flame look to your car. Want to wear a beanie on your roof? Why not? express your uniqueness. Rocket league is all about the fun, and as such these customizable items feel right at home.<br /><br />Rocket League is not perfect. It could use some deeper statistics or leagues as well as sharper teammate AI, but the fundamental game is a riotous good time with plenty of unlockables to keep players coming back for more. The first night I found it entirely too easy to just say 'one more match' - several times in a row.e or the opposite side of our teammate, but the AI teammate did not seem to register we were there and move the ball to us for what should have been an easy score.<br /><br />Clearly the AI has that capability, because we had both seen it perform plays like that against us when all three opposing cars were computer controlled - yet the teammate AI seems to struggle somewhat with human companions.

2992,US,40702997,RH7HVXQVAV5IX,B00PGKK2IY,N,N,"Cut Corners and half-implemented ideas lead to an average game that's not terrible, but not a classic either","Note: I've previously posted this review on the game's Steam Store page<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the classic Build Engine shooters such as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood, so I was surprised that I had never heard of Nam (first released in 1998) before it popped up on Steam. After playing through the singleplayer campaign, I now know why.<br /><br />The basic shooting action of Nam is enjoyable and I had fun with the game overall, but unfortunately Nam falls into the trap of lazy production and bad game design too often to be considered a true classic. Like I said before, the shooting aspect of this game is solid. Enemies go down in one or two shots and the player character doesn't survive much more, which makes for some tense, thrilling shootouts when the game decides to play fair. The difficulty kind of reminded me of Hotline Miami and this is definitely a game where you'll be saving anytime you kill an enemy. What also impressed me is that even though this is an arcade shooter at heart and not really &#34;realistic&#34;, the enemy placement does actually seem to conform with the tactics used by the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. Usually enemies are hiding around corners or behind plants, meaning they can take you by surprise quite often and you'll oftentimes find yourself shooting blindly into the jungle to try and wipe out as many as you can before walking into their hands. It is these moments when Nam is at its most interesting, and the number of deaths you will go through during the game's 14 or so singleplayer levels will definitely drive home how effective the tactics the Viet Cong used in the Vietnam War were. Beating each level genuinely felt like an accomplishment and trying to get through without dying was an intense game of survival. There are really only three or four kinds of enemies (grunts, suicide bombers, tanks, and snipers), and while I usually rag on games for lack of enemy variety, I didn't feel like that was a detriment here, as the enemies the game does have provide more than enough challenge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Nam's moments of quality are severely hampered by some bad design decisions and lazy production choices. The main thing that drove me insane in this game were the landmines and airstrikes. Each level is littered with green landmines that blend with the grass. You generally won't see these until it's too late, so tossing some grenades or rockets into an area you're about to enter is advisable. I guess the landmines fit in with the theme of realistic Viet Cong tactics and again it does drive home how hard it would be to survive in such a situation, but from the standpoint of game design they just added cheap fake difficulty and didn't really do anything to make the combat more enjoyable. You'll also find yourself being driven insane by so-called &#34;friendly&#34; airstrikes. Throughout the levels, you can find radios to call in an airstrike on the area ahead, which is pretty cool and fun. Unfortunately, this game has tons of airstrikes that you don't call for and these can happen very quickly, giving you little time to take cover sometimes. The game also has a &#34;bleeding&#34; mechanic where you can gradually lose health over a period of time, but the bleeding doesn't seem to happen logically. When you get shot, you instantly lose health, but don't bleed. Instead, bleeding seems to be caused by bumping into certain walls and corners, and sometimes by jumping. The fact that the bleeding only seems to happen when your health is in single digits does not help things, and overall it makes for a pointless and annoying mechanic. Furthermore, some of the level designs employ some really bad game design choices. One of the levels near the end has a part where you need to drop down from a fall-damage inducing height not once, but twice in a row, and doesn't give you any compensation for it, which takes a massive chunk of health away from you and made the level unwinnable for me untilI reloaded an earlier save where I had more health. With that said, when the levels were good, the shootouts were fun, but this game really does make some boneheaded mistakes that are detrimental to its enjoyment.<br /><br />Furthermore, this game has lots of rough edges and parts where you can obviously see cut-corners and half-implemented ideas. Where other Build games such as Blood and Shadow Warrior had their own identity, this game constantly reminds you that it's basically a mod of Duke Nukem 3D. Lots of sprites and art assets are recycled from Duke, which is fine for some things like environmental textures, but then you've got the shotgun ammo box using the same bright-red sprite as it did in Duke, which doesn't fit in with the Vietnam theme and the general look of the game's new content. The game also uses Duke's grunts of pain when you get shot, which is jarring, as the newly recorded lines for this game's character sound nothing like Duke's voice. As for the new art assets, they really aren't that good, even by build engine standards. Duke, Shadow Warrior, and Blood all had beautiful sprites that make those games look great despite their age. This game (which came out 2 years after Duke) on the other hand looks like most of it was drawn in MS-Paint. The tanks are cartoony and have no presence in the world (previous games on this engine avoided this through skillfully detailed sprites), and while the Viet Cong enemies are reasonably detailed, American forces look downright amateur (although they're kind of cute in a goofy way). Also, the weapons are renders of cheap-looking 3D models and the weapon sprites really haven't been worked with to make them look particularly good in the engine. It might sound harsh to criticize a game from 1998 for its graphics, but compared to games that came out two years before (again, Duke 3D and the like), this game doesn't hold up. The environments aren't bad looking, but that's mainly because they reuse Duke 3D textures.<br /><br />This game did try to add a few interesting things to the Build Engine formula, but unfortunately most of the new features are half-implemented or otherwise broken. One cool thing this game attempts is that it has NPC's who do things and sometimes talk to you. For the characters that give you the mission objectives, this works well, but once you start trying to use the combat NPC's, things fall apart. There's a medic you can talk to who heals you back to full health, and you can ask him to follow you, which is useful and he generally doesn't have any issues navigating flat terrain (although the NPC's can't jump, so they won't follow you through the whole level). Overall, the medic's pretty impressive, so he gets a pass. Next up is the gunner, and this is where everything falls apart. You can ask gunners to follow you around, so you would expect them to provide backup, but unfortunately they don't seem to actually shoot anything, making their entire existance pointless. Furthermore, there are only two or three levels that try to involve these NPCs beyond the briefing guy at the beginning of most levels, so the game really doesn't make use of its friendly NPCs (other than the medic) in any meaningful combat capacity. The game also peppers &#34;Viet Cong Ammo&#34; throughout several levels. You can't use it in your own guns, so for half the game, I was wondering what the point was. Then, in exactly one level, I came across a mounted gun that supposedly uses this ammo. I hit the use key and a message came up saying &#34;you need Viet Cong Ammo to fire this gun&#34;, even though I literally just picked up some that was lying next to the gun. It's a mechanic that only actually shows up in one level despite being teased in several, only to not work when it does show up.<br /><br />For all the ragging I've done on this game, I did have fun with it when the level design was good, and the bad parts don't destroy it. I wouldn't reccomend it as an introduction to 90's shooters, nor would I say it's worth $7, but if you've already beaten the Build classics and can get it for about $1.70 like I did, it's fun. It's not a classic, but it's not awful either.g things to the Build Engine formula, but unfortunately most of the new features are half-implemented or otherwise broken.

I paid for it and noticed nothing had changed. My ping was the exact same. I spoke to support and they kept telling me for 2 weeks to try this options, try that option. They couldn't figure out anything. After 2 weeks of no improvements the support person finally said they'll be having a new update that will probably reduce my ping around 100. I asked when and he couldn't provide me with an answer. Now i'm stuck with this and paid for 3 months for nothing. If your play BnS in the West coast/Mid west there is no reason in getting this as it doesn't help at all. Money went to waste.",2015-08-02

3013,US,40702997,R3JH8MY4BOBDZ8,B009IXL4PA,N,Y,"Has some technical issues, but is overall an above average FPS with some interesting ideas.","Note: I've previously posted this review on the game's Steam Store page<br /><br />Project: Snowblind isn't going to go down as one of the great legendary FPS games, but it is a very good game for the $1.50 I paid for it. The structure of the game is that of your usual single-player fps campaign (beating a linear series of levels), but it does some interesting things that make it worth playing.<br /><br />The combat in this game is excellent. Each weapon is interesting and fun to use, but more importantly each weapon is useful for different types situations, meaning you'll be switching which one you use frequently. Furthermore, they all retain their usefullness throughout the campaign, meaning you won't be lugging around a bunch of useless weapons by the time the endgame rolls around. Each weapon also has an alt-fire, which expands their possibilities even more.<br /><br />This game started off as a spin-off of Deus Ex, and even though the final product no longer shares that title or universe (and doesn't have any rpg elements, being a pure FPS), it does let you use the same of type nano-augmentations to give you the upper hand in combat. This ranges from making your self invisible, to shooting electric bolts, to becoming completely invulnerable. These augmentations let you try a variety of different strategies for approaching each battle and did a great job of spicing up the game (although I did find myself using the invulerability one pretty much exclusively it was made available). Also like Deus Ex, there is also a hacking element. You have a device called the &#34;icepick&#34; that lets you fire a dart onto anything that's hackable and then take control of that thing remotely. This allows you to take control of turrets and mechs, and using them to turn the tables on the enemies is hilarious and awesome.<br /><br />The last thing in terms of gameplay I want to bring up is that the level design is excellent. Even though the levels are mostly linear, each area gives you a handful of options and alternate routes, meaning you could go in guns blazing, or you could try to find a sneakier path and do things stealthily. Overall, the gameplay is Project: Snowblind's strongest point, as the weapon design, level design, and augmentations blend together brilliantly.<br /><br />Despite the excellent gameplay, there are a handful of areas Project: Snowblind falls short in, some of which were detrimental to my enjoyment of the game, some not so much. The biggest issue I had with this game is that the saves are handled using manual checkpoints you must find and activate within the level, as opposed to being able to save where you want or using automatic checkpoints. Normally, I don't mind checkpoints too much, but Project: Snowblind only has one or two of these points per level, meaning that if you die, you usually have to replay much more of what you just did than is desirable (usually about 7 or 8 minutes worth). What's even worse is these checkpoints are sometimes hidden in obscure, out of the way places and in some levels I couldn't even find them despite the game having a feature telling you what direction you should be heading to find them. These checkpoints really drag down the game, and whenever I found myself quitting the game, it was usually because I was tired of having to replay massive swaths just to retry one point.<br /><br />On the technical side, Snowblind has a few glaring issues as well. I had the game crash on me several times during my playthrough. This was especially annoying because they usually happened once I finally overcame whatever section of the game I was stuck on (meaning I would have to replay that part yet again once I restarted the game). Annother annoying bug is that there is something wrong with the game's contrast, making everything look extremely washed out making stuff that's supposed to be black more of a gray. This seems to effect everyone's copy and I haven't found any kind of workaround or fix. Take a loot at the user posted screenshots on this game's Steam community hub, then compare them to the screenshots on the Store page, and you will see that something is very wrong. This is extremely annoying and even makes the game hard to look at in places, which is unfortunate, because you can tell the game has decent art direction and isn't supposed to look like this (videos I watched of the PS2 and Xbox versions seemed to be fine however). With that said, I was able to look past this and enjoy the gameplay (which again, is excellent), but this is something you should know about going in.<br /><br />The storyline is a weak point as well, but it does have some merit. The overall plot is completely forgettable, basically serving as an excuse for you to shoot your way through each level (as an aside, nearly every cutscene contains a helicopter either destroying something or getting destroyed. This is not a problem). The most interesting thing about the storyline is that the big evil plot that you try to prevent is almost identical to one of the ending options from Deus Ex 1, but that's about it. With that said, the character themselves were actually pretty likeable and distinct, and there is some pretty good voice acting as well (the game also has a surprisingly decent sense of humor that pops up now and them). You won't care why you're fighting this war, but you will enjoy the company.<br /><br />Overall, Project: Snowblind is pretty solid for a budget game, thanks to fantastic gameplay (even if it doesn't have much else going for it). I don't think I'll be playing through it a second time, but for $1.50, the ride was a fun one worth taking.ake a loot at the user posted screenshots on this game's Steam community hub, then compare them to the screenshots on the Store page, and you will see that something is very wrong.

After that irritation, I expected to just be able to get right into the game, Im a huge DA fanatic, but it made me go through a Release Date Check, something I had never heard of before. I tried doing the date check many times and got an error every time. I had to go through an hour an a half long process with Securom before I was able to do any playing. It was unbelievably frustrating, and would be almost impossible for someone without computer knowledge. Long story short, the whole process took longer and was more frustrating than anything I have done on the computer in a long, LONG while. I apologize to Amazon for them taking any blame that isn't theirs, I just wanted people to know how much of a turn off this whole process was.",2015-08-01

Since I played so much I picked up a lot of tips, if anyone is interested.<br /><br />SPOILERS*******<br /><br />WORK/MONEY: put them at desk/kitchen/workbench and praise them 3X. When they run away drag them back and make them work. Do this 5X, letting them work through an entire cycle each time. If they balk and say no, keep putting them at their work station until they work.<br /><br />ENERGY: Making coffee gives them energy. So does watching the rain, resting in the hammock and playing in the pool (for the kids). The best energy builder is having them read magazines. You can even get the kids to do this. Simply toss them into the alley between the bookcase and the desk in the office. You can keep doing this until their energy bar is completely filled up and they're hyper. Making them drink coffee is harder. They'll only do it in the morning and you have to hunt out the hot spot to put them so they'll make coffee. It can be anywhere in or outside the house with a line of sight to the coffee maker.<br /><br />FOOD: The cheaper food will make them sick. The barbecue uses less food while filling them up, and less energy is used. The kids under 14 can't use it. But you can fill them up--slowly--by having them snack at the kitchen counter. You have to keep putting them at it and it takes awhile. Best used when you want them topped off before bed, but you don't want to prepare a meal. On the other hand, having an adult prepare a meal before bed will tire them and make sure they sleep. See next heading.<br /><br />SLEEP: They need to be tired before or exhausted before bedtime. Don't let them nap, read a magazine before bed. To wear out parents: have them prepare a meal and clean up after a meal. You can have them both do these chores together so they both get worn out. Have them work on their careers right up to bedtime. Kids: put them at the desk in the bedroom. Keep putting them at it. This will slowly wear them out. But it also makes them hungr so either have a meal waiting for them, or have them snack in between studying at the desk. Both parents and kids: make them water the plants and play video games. Playing video games is the best way to wear them out, but it also impacts their health. Give them the hand soap and vitamins. Or don't worry, they'll be fine after they sleep.<br /><br />WEEDS: If there are a lot, energize your people with coffee or magazine reading. If your weeds are not pulled quickly enough you can be fined.<br /><br />FIXING PROBLEMS: Leaky Sinks: put your person in the workshop at the back wall of cabinets. They will find a giant wrench and and run back to fix the sink. Leaky Toilet/Shower: put them on top of the basket in the laundry room with the duster in it. They will find a plunger and run back to fix it. No Internet: put them at the router box next to the lefthand computer in the office. They will fix. Oven/Dryer Lint Fire:  put your person at open shed door until they grab the fire extinguisher. They'll run back and fix. Cracks in the Floor: buy floor fixer, put it near crack, keep putting them on the crack--it will take them many times to finish. Wall graffiti: buy wall fixer, take it to the bucket next to the sandbox, have person fill with water (drop them on the hose next to the bucket). They will carry the bucket to the wall. You have to keep putting them at the wall until the bucket disappears and the wall is finished. Broken Birdbath: buy the pump, put it on the fountain, put two adults or teens on the fountain. Leaky Hose: buy the duct tape, drop it on the hose. Have one of your people get a drink of water, take a shower or do dishes. While the water is running drop someone on the hose.<br /><br />OPENING THE SHED DOOR: put adult in the sandbox. They will take knob to shed door. Put person on welcome mat. They will get the key and go open the door. (Opening the shed door will make pieces of the photo that needs to be collected show up around the shed and workshop.)<br /><br />Hope this helps. Enjoy!pening the shed door will make pieces of the photo that needs to be collected show up around the shed and workshop.)<br /><br />Hope this helps. Enjoy!",2015-08-01

I tried several issue choices until I hit the right one, which I think had something to do with changing the screen mode or size. Before I did this it would just load the ScreenSeven Game Center, but when I would click on &#34;Play&#34; it would just reload the Game Center again. After the compatibility app. fixed the problem it loaded the game which was a lot of fun. Since I enjoy puzzle games like Myst, Riven, and Rhem, this was not a very difficult game to complete without using any hints, but for those that get stuck often, I can highly recommend this game because when my cousin played it, he got stuck often and used the &#34;Hints&#34; and &#34;Skip&#34; option a lot and was able to finish the game frustration free.

Complete with a physics engine that lets you drive up walls and propel yourself to flight, the game strikes the right balance between the fantastical and the realistic. The little touches such as the ball exploding when it scores and the ability to demolish opposing vehicles by smashing into them with great force add such a primitive childlike joy to the experience that cannot be overstated.<br /><br />The childlike quality this games evokes even becomes manifest in the way that nearly everyone plays this game. The standard match is 3 vs. 3, with the cars being placed in different positions at the start of play. However, at the conclusion of the countdown from 3, 2, 1‚Ä¶ most players immediately charge for the ball, regardless of where they were lined up at the start of play. Sometimes people will even wait until after the 'kickoff'. But for most of the game, you'll be able to observe 5 crazy cars all chasing after the ball, catering to its whims and fancies as it flies around the arena. Basically, it's like watching a bunch of 5 year olds play soccer with RC cars. And I wouldn't have it any other way.",2015-08-01

3169,US,40788541,RZEZMAYJ2W6ND,B00U6INR9C,N,N,"Don't let the colorful and cute graphics fool you, Shiftlings is a very challenging game.","Thank you Sierra for sending us this game to review!<br /><br />Shiftlings is a 3D platformer/puzzle game about an interplanetary game show that features two custodians who are conjoined by an air hose.  These janitorial aliens are thrown into deadly puzzles and they must make their way to the repair station to activate the exit and move on to the next level.  In total there are fifty levels that take place on five wacky planets.  In each level there are three bottles of Black Hola Cola waiting to be collected.  Future levels are unlocked by collecting the required amount of Black Hola Colas.<br /><br />This mysterious beverage grants the aliens the ability to shape shift.  One alien is skinny and one of them is inflated.  They can swap modes as long as there is enough room for the inflated alien where the skinny one is currently standing.  Each mode has its advantages. The smaller alien can jump higher and interact with switches while the inflated alien can pull the smaller one and move heavy boxes.  The smaller alien can jump on top of the inflated one trampoline style to reach higher ground.<br /><br />The puzzles gradually get harder and thankfully you can usually take your time solving them.  That is if you don't want to partake in the time attack or leader boards.  After ten levels in the planet are completed, the time attack mode and leader board become unlocked.  A challenging bonus level will become available as well.  Thankfully these brutally hard levels are completely optional to complete.<br /><br />There are various jumping puzzles and obstacles like deadly flames and lasers to avoid.  The major limitation is the air hose that connects the two aliens together.  If their air hose gets severed they will die and will re-spawn at the beginning of the level or at the last checkpoint.  Any Black Hola Colas gained since the check point will have to be re-acquired and this is usually not a simple task.<br /><br />Even though Shiftlings is very playable by itself, it's best played with a partner to control the other alien.  Unfortunately, I was not able to find any active games with players online.  I did get a Steam achievement for inviting someone to join my game though.  Other than Steam achievements, there are trading cards and cloud saves.<br /><br />The ESRB gave Shiftlings a Teen rating, but I found the game to be more silly than anything and had no problems letting my kids play it on my PC.  There is cartoon violence and lots of silly humor.  The announcer will insult your intelligence a bit when you carelessly die and he does make a comment or two with sexual innuendo.  The background announcements are funny to listen to and the one about lethal spankings made my kids laugh.<br /><br />Don't let the colorful and cute graphics fool you, Shiftlings is a very challenging game.  I enjoyed it best in small doses.  It may lure kids in, but the difficult levels may scare them off after a while.  The price is a reasonable $14.99 on Steam and there is a free demo available if you want to give it a try before buying it.  I highly recommend it if you enjoy puzzle games.  If you're just looking for a platformer game, you may want to look elsewhere.lf, it's best played with a partner to control the other alien.

When I bought this, it was $10 on amazon and it was a must-buy. Each game can honestly give you around 50 hours of gameplay, and more so on Mass Effect 3 with its multiplayer. The story of Mass Effect is superb and probably one of the best things to ever come out of Bioware. What I liked was making my character and then progressing through all 3 games with the same guy because you're able to import your saved character from the previous games.<br /><br />There are lots of choices you can make in Mass Effect that affect the overall story. This feels a lot like KOTOR, which is not a bad thing and at $30 (what it is priced at at the time of this review) you can't go wrong. My only gripe is that you do not get much of the DLC with this package and you have to purchase those separately with Bioware Points. All of the DLC is still full priced as when they were released (GG right?)<br /><br />Even without the DLC, these games are worth it and you'll be completely immersed and moved by the story.",2015-07-31

3283,US,7320898,R3PNMDAGAXTZLO,B00DOD11RQ,N,N,Planetside 2 IS balanced!,"Alright, because I don't see ANY other really descriptive reviews that make sense on the current version of the game. Let me explain.  Planetside 2 is a free roaming FPS in where you can fly, walk, or just drive to any area on one of 4 giant maps. For all factions there are 215 weapons (Approx) and 84 for one faction alone (Approx) Anything that you can &#34;Buy&#34; is purely for convenience, nothing more. You can go buy a weapon instantly with RL (Real life) currency, or you can save up with In game currency and buy it the exact same way. Though most people who have played the game much longer such as myself to have a larger selection, nothing will give me an actual advantage over you because almost all weapons that are new are only for different situations, not better than eachother. For instance a snipe rifle isn't as good as a shotgun CQC (close quarters combat) Though there is only one downside to the game, it is pretty demanding of good hardware. So be sure to check out the &#34;Minimum requirements&#34; Before you get hyped!  In conclusion: Give the game a try for yourself! Remember if you have any problems don't just give it one star, send a support ticket and get help!  Thank you for taking my review into consideration!  ~Ian",2015-07-30

Brings back many fun memories from the past, while being an awesome introduction to those who are brand new to the game itself.<br /><br />Here's what enjoyable:<br />- Interesting storyline that's riddled with fun humor.<br />- Beautiful and stunning, 3D scenery that makes you want to stop and take in the beauty before continuing on at times.<br />- Lots of fun elements, decisions to make, puzzles / challenges to solve -- typical King's Quest-style entertainment.<br />- Interactive conversations between your hero and other story characters. (Heart-touching story, at times.)<br /><br />What you might want to know:<br />- Uses the traditional [WASD] or [arrow keys] for character navigation. Mouse is used for up-close looking observation / pointing and shooting (arrows, etc). This is needed, in my opinion, as you need both the mouse and keyboard for full interaction in this new, 3D environment.<br /><br />I think the game could get a bit boring once you have completed it / solved the puzzles, etc. However, five different chapters are promised (and only the first is available). So far, I love it...",2015-07-30

Most of them were trial and error and chance games. Unless you had cheats it was hard to figure out. I DO NOT WANT TO GET STARTED ON SCOPA I COULD RANT ABOUT IT FOREVER. This stupid game is the hardest thing I Have ever done on Nancy Drew. It is a card game that you have to play against this guy. Not that the card game is hard... it is that you have to play this guy so many times before you can beat him before you can win. It took me a whole day to just do this one part. AND WHEN I THOUGHT I FINALLY BEAT HIM... I had to do it a second time for my payment. I SWEAR I WAS GOING TO PUNCH MY COMPUTER. I have no idea if others had problems with it but I hated it.

3318,US,43030375,R1RKTN73FJECOK,B00V3TKDJU,N,Y,A dismally poor port to PC,"First of all the game this has a masochistic design. If you don't mind being brutally punished upon any respawn, then you will probably enjoy it. Just keep in mind that if you get to 50% completion of a level and die, all mobs will respawn, and you will have to repeat the level. You can't just save your progress and start from your point of failure. The 2nd time through will be  easier but if this time you die at 75%, you have to start again from the beginning, etc. etc. until you make it through with a 100% completion. There is no satisfaction from being able to casually walk through and explore a completed level since everything will have respawned. This is not really a complaint as it is a warning of the game mechanics. Personally I like being able to save my progress and find it frustrating having to repeat/repeat from dying. I do understand that it is this unique game design that appeals to many. Not complaining, just a heads up on what to expect.<br /><br />My main gripe is that the PC version of the game was not completely ported over. There are hints throughout the game but the hints refer to console type buttons (as on an Xbox Game Pad). Hints with references to the DS button, etc.!!!! The tutorial phase of the game is meaningless because of this. To play the game on a PC using a mouse and keyboard requires going through all manner of gyrations. You have to install a mouse macro program and run a special script. I have a real problem with buying a game and then having to go through crap like this to play it. The PC version of the game should be accompanied with a warning of these limitations. Basically, the PC version of the game is best played with an xbox class game pad. All of the special moves and button combination are geared to an Xbox class game pad. And even if you have one, there is no guarantee you will be able to get it to work. I happen to have such a game pad (logitech F130) and even that required making changes in device manager like disablingcertain devices, installing special drivers, etc. I could not get my device to work and apparently would have to buy another game pad for any hopes of being able to play the game on my PC - All because they apparently didn't think it was necessary to deliver a completed PC ported game.<br /><br />If it was just the masochistic game mechanics, I could accept that and simply put it in my software grave yard with other games I didn't like, but selling a PC version of this game in its current state is robbery in my opinion and arguably misrepresentation.<br /><br />If you are interested in the PC version, I suggest you make sure you have an Xbox class game controller. If you plan to play this game using a mouse and keyboard, be prepared to roll up your sleeves and deal with installing a macro mouse program like Automouse and either finding a suitable script or writing your own. Before purchasing, google the PC version of this game for a good heads up on what to expect.",2015-07-30

King's Quest games (in case you were wondering).  It has been really fun and really funny so far!  I've only played through once, but I think that there might be multiple ways to solve some of the puzzles and it might be worth a reply just to try those out.<br />I will say that the art is beautiful!  It is at about the right level of difficulty I think - not too hard, but not too easy either.  Some of the puzzles are pretty straightforward to solve because there is not anything else you can do.  Others take more work.  There are also action moments that sometimes take a few tries, like avoiding obstacles while floating down a river or even shooting ropes and other things while you or they are moving.  It was a lot of fun!  I also loved watching Gwendolyn interact with her grandpa and her cousin.<br />This is a puzzle solving type of game with a lot of heart and story to it.

It sat on my PS4, unused, for several weeks. I didn't think I would have any interest in the game - but I was wrong. I fired Rocket League up last night, and I was immediately delighted. The thing that instantly makes this game a 10/10 is that it actually features COUCH CO-OP PLAY! Not only that, but it's incredibly fun! We were sitting in the living room last night, laughing uncontrollably, cursing at the TV screen, and having a blast. Rocket League reminds me of the old days, when you could sit together with your firends and family and play fun games on the same console, on the same TV, in the same room. The best single word for this game is: FUN! The concept is simple, the physics are genius, and the results are hilarious.

First of all, people are saying that you don't really affect the storyline, well as a matter of fact you do. You need to play all the episodes and as you play, each one builds on another. For example if someone dies or if you marry someone. It's definitely for the casual gamer. Gamers out there looking for a lot of shooting and fighting, you will be disappointed. It is mainly a story that you follow along and make decisions. It's a lot of cut scenes. I really enjoy this game and I hope those don't get let down by the first episode. Keep playing!

First, off Re: Hollow Fragment is an improved version of &#34;Sword Art Online Hollow Fragment&#34; which released on the PlayStation Vita, and the Vita version is an improved version of the PSP game &#34;Sword Art Online Infinity Moment&#34;. You can't complain and say that the game looks graphically underwhelming, the game is a port of the Vita version, but it does improve upon the graphics and most importantly the English translation.<br /><br />Anyone who played the PlayStation Vita version, knows just how bad the English translation was, Re: Hollow Fragment fixes most of that. If you purchase this, just know you aren't getting groundbreaking graphics or the most complex well thought out story, what you're getting is a fun action RPG, and if you can look past the graphics, then I believe you will enjoy Re: Hollow Fragment.<br /><br />I also wanted to add that purchasing the game from Amazon was quick and painless, all in all took a few seconds and I had my code.

Gameplay when you do get a good random load (for maybe 5-8 minutes) is its fun.

3462,US,7003611,R1QE2XBYRKVVYB,B00HQ0WNI4,N,Y,The Alien game we've all been waiting for,"This is the game we've all been waiting for. Whereas most Alien games are inspired by Cameron's sequel, Alien: Isolation is one big love-letter to Ridley Scott's film. There's only one alien and you can't kill it. You have to rely on stealth to survive. This is great for so many reasons. My biggest issue with horror games these days is that they make me feel too powerful. Dead Space gives you tons of weapons and even though you have to conserve ammo, I was always able to kill all the enemies in the area (and often I had to in order to progress). Isolation gives you three weapons, but you barely have any ammo most of the time and they only briefly stall the alien. It's a perfect balance of making me feel like I'm making progress but still feeling helpless and scared.<br /><br />The alien itself is terrifying and it's programming is excellent. It never felt like a video game enemy following a pre-set path, it acts the way a xenomorph should; unpredictable and constantly changing strategy. You also face humans and androids throughout the game. Humans are rarely seen and when they are it's challenging because if you're seen they start shooting you and the noise attracts the alien. You can make noise so the alien shows up and starts killing them, but then you have that to worry about. The androids are unfortunately more an annoyance than anything else and by the end of the game I was really getting sick of them. Every time they get close you're thrown into an annoying quick time event that really got old after a while. The game is mostly stealth-based, and it's intense, challenging, and fun like a survival-horror game should be. The areas you explore are very open giving the game plenty of replay-value. There is a ton of short mini-games and interactive moments (like having to press a button for every step of pulling a switch) which normally I would hate but here it works very well. It was always scary to have to go through the process of starting up a generator when there's an alien nearby that could attack me any second.<br /><br />The game is incredibly atmospheric and perfectly captures the tone and feel of the original film. The creators clearly love Alien because they got every detail right and according to the art designer, everything in the game was designed as if it was a prop in a 1979 sci-fi movie. They even got the whole cast of the original back (except for Ian Holm) to voice the characters they played in audio diaries hidden throughout the game. My only issue in regards to the nostalgia-factor is that the entire game is designed like the Nostromo which was cool at first but by the end of the game I was kind of wishing for more variety as most of the areas you go through look the same.<br /><br />So gameplay-wise, it's amazing. Story-wise... it leaves a lot to be desired. It has the usual Alien story we've all seen before and while the backstory and events leading up to the start are very interesting, the main plot is very forgettable. Even worse are the characters who are all bland and I had trouble caring about any of them. There's some bad voice acting for a couple characters too, including the protagonist. Also there is a point late in the game where the alien disappears for a couple hours and you mostly face those annoying androids. It really hurt the pacing and it was clearly just there to extend the length of the game.<br /><br />It has a few faults but I think the good far outweigh the bad. It's excellent and gameplay-wise it's one of the best survival-horror games I have ever played. Even if you're not typically into video games I'd still recommend it if you're a fan of the Alien films.re's an alien nearby that could attack me any second.<br /><br />The game is incredibly atmospheric and perfectly captures the tone and feel of the original film. The creators clearly love Alien because they got every detail right and according to the art designer, everything in the game was designed as if it was a prop in a 1979 sci-fi movie. They even got the whole cast of the original back (except for Ian Holm) to voice the characters they played in audio diaries hidden throughout the game. My only issue in regards to the nostalgia-factor is that the entire game is designed like the Nostromo which was cool at first but by the end of the game I was kind of wishing for more variety as most of the areas you go through look the same.<br /><br />So gameplay-wise, it's amazing. Story-wise... it leaves a lot to be desired.

The lishor faction was fun as they had monster plants that would multiply and spit acid against targets. The human factions were a bit one dimensional not having any advantage or disadvantage over the others. But playing the monsters was fun. There were several monster factions that made it more interesting. Humans just built cities and raised armies and towers and other buildings castles were good.

3560,US,53090127,R2CLUUCAVBHN1F,B00P9QGNEM,N,N,Awkward controls but otherwise fine (short) platformer that doesn't wear out welcome,"Never Alone is a puzzle-platformer whose primary purpose is to provide cultural understanding of the Inupiat Alaskan natives. The game tells a story (in the Inupiat language with subtitles provided) about a girl who sets out to free her village from an eternal blizzard. The story is well told and full of atmosphere, with cut-scenes provided through faux-historic pictograms. It's pretty, and part of the reason I kept playing even though I don't usually enjoy platformers.<br /><br />The game is clearly written to be played with two players at once: if you're a solo player, you'll have to flip between the two characters (the girl and her arctic fox) in order to get through some of the puzzles. Because certain puzzles have a time limit (especially near the end of the game), this could lead you to repeat sections over and over until you get it right, which can be frustrating. Fortunately, the game's checkpointing system is fairly well thought out, and you usually will not repeat any puzzle which you can do once.<br /><br />The closest comparison game I'd compare this to is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Both use a puzzle platformer to tell a story, and because the game has a goal other than to provide extended play time or to challenge the players, the puzzles are straightforward.<br /><br />As a single player, however, the approach of Brothers is the considerably better one, with the controls for Never Alone never really feeling comfortable, and frequently awkward. However, what the game excels at (and this is an excellent reason to play and experience the game) is mapping the platforming adventure to the environment of the harsh arctic circle. Frequently, the most dangerous part of the game is the environment, not the polar bears or the enemies, real or mythical. Furthermore, the game ends just about when it starts to wear out its welcome (3 hours 10 minutes is the average), a rare demonstration of restraint amongst video games.<br /><br />I got this as part of the Playstation Plus subscription. I can't imagine paying the full $14.99 price for this game, but considering the other PS+ games that never get played more than a couple of times, I'd say that this game is considerably more respectful of my time than other games, is beautifully rendered, and therefore worthy of your consideration if it were to be suitable discounted (it was recently on sale on steam for $6.99, and on PSN for $6.00). Considering that it includes 24 videos that essentially form an hour long documentary about the Inupiat Eskimos, that would be a very attractive price if you have an interest in the topic.<br /><br />The game is available on XBox One, PS4, PC, and Macintosh.<br /><br />Recommended.",2015-07-28

I downloaded this game on MyPlayCity.com and have already played it all the way through, once and I'm just about finished with my 2nd go-around. I love this game for many reasons, such as the storyline where you help out this gal named Pattie who works at the Dress-up pups fashion agency for dogs because her boss, Bernard, has to go out of town on business. I also like the fact that, when it comes to the match-3 part of the game, there's 3 different modes(chain, group and swap). Plus, I also like the different types of tiles such as dog bones, dog houses, dog bowls, dog paws, dog collars, slices of cheese, envelopes, etc. I also like the 6 power-ups that help you out during the levels. I also like that, to complete the level, you have to get rid of a certain number of colored squares, some green & some blue. The former takes one match to eliminate & the latter takes 2 matches to eliminate, plus you have to bring a certain number of puzzle pieces down to the bottom of the board. Once that happens, you put together the puzzle pieces to see what the outfit looks like. I really like the conversations that Pattie has with the dog owners. Lastly, I like that, once the outfits are finished and the owners come for the dogs, a picture of the dog in his or her outfit is placed in a gallery so you can see what the dogs look like with the outfits on. So, I recommend this game to anyone who loves dogs or a neat match-3 computer game, or both, like I do because, believe me, this game is TERRIFIC!!!",2015-07-27
3571,US,17058574,R3MP8YOIQO82PX,B00V3TKDJU,N,N,"Patience is a virtue, and virue is its own reward","If you know nothing of the Souls series, each game is an skill-based (not click-fest) action RPG, set in depressing fantasy medieval-like settings, with a huge variety of play styles, armament, enemies, and locations - with the added complexities of other players' advice, last moments, and selves can cross over into your world, to help or hinder you as they see fit.  Scholar of the First Sin fits right in with the previous games in the series, but also serves as the best jumping in point for newcomers - the game features more exposition and built in hints for the players in this iteration than in any previously. It also looks better, loads more quickly, is generally better optimized, has fewer cheaters, and plays more smoothly than its predecessors. Which is not to say that its easier mechanically. For instance - there are fewer points at which you can progress to the point that you no longer have to face the adversaries between where you came from and where you're going (no autosaving your progress through the game; if you die you return to the last bonfire you visited - which function as save points and fast travel nodes - and you must return to where to you died to collect any souls (currency to improve your stats and equipment and buy items) you may have held). Unless you use a specific item or have defeated a boss in the last half-hour, you're much more likely to be invaded by another player who will try to kill you even while you're dealing with any hazards or enemies in your world. These things are mitigated, as all things can be if you continue playing and learning, over time. Defeat the same enemy often enough and they won't appear anymore, making your path easier. The more you're invaded, the better you become, and you'll find more items to prevent invasions.  There are equipment and skill types to accommodate many styles of play, whether you wish to jet around wielding two weapons, or lumber around with heavy armor and shield (or two), stand back with a bow, spells, or pyromancies, or even use your fists, you can probably find a fit for the way that you like to play. Every piece of armor and weapon can be enhanced with the right materials and enough souls and many of them scale with your stats, meaning they become more effective as that stat(s) with which it scales grows. There are always trade offs. Use a heavy weapon and you'd better make sure you have the stamina to swing it and the equipment load to carry it and still avoid enemy attacks. Putting more stat points to increase your stamina will mean forsaking strength, so you won't be hitting as hard, or vitality, so you can't take as many hits (and no matter how good your armor is every hit hurts). These considerations don't even go into the different damage types you can give and receive, the benefits to poise (the threshold to interrupt an attack), casting speeds, and preparation for players versus enemies.  In addition there are covenants which cater to different styles of play. Several task you with invading other players, protecting others, summoning protection, dueling, collecting items, and one even makes the game harder by removing the cap on enemy respawns, making them hit harder and become tougher, and forbidding you from being helped by other players.  Needless to say, this is a very complex game. If you have the patience to observe the effects of changes and how your foes behave, you'll always find ways to improve and find new challenges. That's why I love these games. If you get frustrated because you aren't able to complete some areas, keep trying and you'll find a method or just make your foes disappear through attrition, try another route, another weapon, use a shield, use a bow, pick them off one at a time, etc...  Music is good and well-made. It sets the tone well, but few pieces are particularly memorable.  Lore is still dense, but the plot is almost non-existent. Unlike in, say, Destiny, this is okay. Dark Souls has always been about finding the reason to go on even when everything is against you and without being given much incentive (including story) to persevere other than whatever personal satisfaction you derive by doing so. Whatever reward you get will only help you to survive, not dominate. Those who seek godhood need not apply.  If the lower lows of frustration turn you off much more than the higher highs of really overcoming a difficult challenge, this game probably isn't for you. Nor is it if you don't have time to devote to it. While finding a way to play how you like is possible for nearly any method of play, it may take a long time to get the equipment and stats and gameplay skill to make it possible.  If you like earning your way and overcoming, with constant challenge, buy it. You will regret it often, but when you don't regret it, the feeling is so, so sweet.  Edit 8/4/15 - I played with a controller and I strongly suggest you do as well (Xbox 360 controller for Windows or something similar). Unlike its predecessor, this can be played with a mouse and keyboard, but &#34;can&#34; certainly does not mean &#34;should&#34; in this case.",2015-07-27

However, until Amazon updates the version available on their website, I recommend buying it either directly from the company or on Steam.<br /><br />The download version currently available from Amazon (or at least the version that I downloaded from Amazon) uses broken launcher/updater code that prevents the program from launching.  I contacted the company and they confirmed that this is a known issue and that until Amazon makes the effort to update the patcher on their website, the ksp download from Amazon cannot be patched. Consequently, every time the program launches using the launcher available in the Amazaon download, &#34;launcher.exe&#34;, it will stall as it (unsuccessfully) looks for updates. The very unsatisfactory solution is to create a shortcut to the program's execute file, &#34;ksp.exe&#34;. This allows you to bypass the updater when launching the game and enjoy the KSP experience, but at the cost of never being able to update the game in the future.

Don't let the &#34;bad PC port&#34; reviews scare you from buying this game. With a bit of fixes, this game can really come to life on PC. First, as others have said, DSFix is a must and it can be found on the NexusMods site. A few tweaks within DSFix will fix numerous issues wrong with the regular PC port of the game. Second, by all means a controller is a must have and you should not use keyboard/mouse under any circumstances. Once those requirements are met, this game will be much better than the console version. There are still many PC players who you can play with online or you can team up with a friend. Whatever route you take, as long as you pick up the essential requirements, this game can be a blast and I highly recommend it.",2015-07-25

3926,US,17058574,R1AU9XHAH0L8US,B009XDMQ0W,N,Y,"Wonderful trilogy, but incomplete","The Mass Effect games are some of the best realized and written science fiction media out there. Through the course of the three games you'll encounter some of the most unique and charming personalities in gaming. You'll laugh at them, pity them, hate them, and maybe even love them. The writing and acting are superb for the great majority of the dozens of hours of gametime. The relationships with people, aliens, factions, and governments are the highlight of the games, and are sometimes unforgettable.<br /><br />As Commander Shepard, you're given leeway in saving the galaxy mostly via your binary (trinary?) dialogue and action choices which let you equivocate, or be a paragon or renegade. Most will veer toward either paragon or renegade, since doing so leads to unique actions and can have otherwise impossible solutions be resolved by your innate goodness or total lack of tact. Other than the lack of incentive to choose options based on your own thoughts and feelings, as the games reward only extremism, the system suffers from being too transparent (the good and evil choices are a bit too obvious in their outcomes; a bit of Witcher ambitiousness in effect would be welcome here).<br /><br />It should be noted that the mechanics of each game differ pretty significantly - these are three separate games whose choices and progress transfer over, but other than being a squad-based, third-person, shooter action RPG, they differ quite a bit in how exploration, combat, inventory management, skill progression, and weapon modification work. All the games are awesome, but don't expect them to feel especially cohesive.<br /><br />As others have noted, most DLC is not included in this package. I don't like this and most don't. Adding the missing DLC significantly increases the cost of already quite old games that deserve a true complete package. On the other hand, none of it is essential to the story, though a few (Shadow Broker and Citadel, most notably) really add to it and provide you with more memorable moments with characters that you may have grown very attached to.<br /><br />On the music front, it took me a while to appreciate it, but the Mass Effect trilogy has a wonderful soundtrack.<br /><br />The first game looks pretty dated out of the box. I suggest going to the ini file to adjust the textures at a minimum -<br /><br />  Open %USERPROFILE%\Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect\Config\BioEngine.ini<br />  Replace the following three lines:<br /><br />  TEXTUREGROUP_Character_Diff=(MinLODSize=32,MaxLODSize=512,LODBias=0)<br />  TEXTUREGROUP_Character_Norm=(MinLODSize=32,MaxLODSize=512,LODBias=0)<br />  TEXTUREGROUP_Character_Spec=(MinLODSize=32,MaxLODSize=256,LODBias=0)<br /><br />  ...with these lines:<br /><br />  TEXTUREGROUP_Character_Diff=(MinLODSize=512,MaxLODSize=4096,LODBias=0)<br />  TEXTUREGROUP_Character_Norm=(MinLODSize=512,MaxLODSize=4096,LODBias=0)<br />  TEXTUREGROUP_Character_Spec=(MinLODSize=256,MaxLODSize=4096,LODBias=0)<br />Other ways to improve the games can be found online, like controller support (which I've really enjoyed).<br /><br />There's been much outcry about the trilogy's ending (as with many series - they're bound to end in a way that doesn't fit with what much of the audience expects to be appropriate), but I found it a profound commentary that fit with the overall message of the games: an individual can change the universe through actions and attitudes, but there are many individuals with strong wills and some things can't be prevented. We live with the illusion of control, and the proof that we don't really have it, everyday. I feel like this series smacks you in the face with that fact by the end.<br /><br />In short. This is essential gaming for the memorable events, places, and characters with lasting choices (that don't prevent the inevitable) and varied, solid tactical gameplay. It's without most DLC and the games don't play or look the same.",2015-07-24

3943,US,36692868,R1OWGOCJNID410,B0112VRDC8,N,N,Trove Power Pack review and item outline,"I've been playing this great game since it went Open Beta. The game is a lot of fun. The Power Pack being sold here is not required as Trove is Free-to-Play. Now...., I know there will be naysayers that will try to detract from Trove simply because it is F2P and also has a cash shop. Let's be clear, the cash shop offers mainly &#34;cosmetic items&#34; and some boosts and mounts. There is nothing there that will give anyone an undue advantage in the game. The game is  mostly about adventuring, dungeoneering, building up your house plot, and creating wonders in your own personal Club world. The game play is very casual although someone could make it intense I guess, if that's what they wanted to do.  As for this Power Pack,   Two Class Tokens and Two Flask Tokens (non-tradable)   Fire Wings, 3 Pearls of Wisdom   2000 of each Primal Block   Trovian Supercycle, Trove Topper   S.S. Trovian, Trovian Sail  Class Coins - gets you 2 additional classes to play with right away. All the classes currently available in-game are ALL able to be earned by saving up Cubits which is a in-game currency that can be earned from the tutorial quests chain, daily dungeon crawls, collecting items, and ranking up some skills to advance your achievements (called Mastery). There are currently 11 classes in-game with more to come. With average game play, you should be able to earn enough Cubits to open buy 1 class per week on average.  Flask Tokens - gets you 2 Flasks of health to play with right away. Everyone starts with a basic flask. Again, Flasks are completely able to be earned by saving up Cubits in-game as are the Emblems which are boosters that  compliment the Flasks.  3 Pearls of Wisdom , used in the forging up of gear. These can be bought from in-game Pirate vendors (NPCs) with another currency earned while playing.  Fire Wings: Note: ALL wings currently have the same speed for gliding. You earn a FREE set of basic wings in-game from ranking up your Mastery levels. All other wings in-game are purely cosmetic. They all serve the same basic function - gliding.  2000 of each Primal Block - You can get blocks just about anywhere in the game with a skill that everyone starts with. Getting 2000 of each block up front is purely convenience because you don't have to invest the time to dig them up.  Note: Trovian Supercycle, Trove Topper, S.S. Trovian, Trovian Sail are only available in the Power Pack. No where else in-game.  Trovian Supercycle - all mounts, except the starting mount, have the same speed. Everyone starts with a slow mount. Getting the faster mount requires nothing more than farming some ingame resources and crafting one...OR, you might get lucky and get one from a random drop off of monsters killed.  Trove Topper is a cosmetic Style to alter the cosmetic appearance of your character.  S.S. Trovian, Trovian Sail - A boat and a sail with a unique look. There are many different boats and sails. Some boats can be crafted, some purchased in the cash shop. Most boats are of the same speed although there are some with slightly better speed  and some with slightly better maneuverability. Nothing that gives superior advantage other than they might get to a distant shore a couple of seconds faster.  For reference, I personally do not own this pack yet but plan on purchasing it in the near term for the Power Pack only items.",2015-07-24

If you have a love for exploration and treasure hunting - you should pick up this game.  As a prisoner exiled to a large island you're immediately given freedom to do whatever you'd like - and face the consequences. There are hundreds of places to visit, but you won't be ready for, or welcome in, many of them. There are many faces and races to be seen, but they won't always be happy to see yours - regardless of the face you wear or choices you've made, many won't like you, be you a paragon of virtue and finder of lost rings, or a long-time cat burglar and assassin. You can steal from the merchant (and maybe get caught and jailed, losing some of your skill and most won't buy stolen items). You can butter him up for a better price. You could work hard and pay asking price. You could kill him and make the guards and rest of the town hostile to you (except for maybe his business rival).  There is a main narrative which is pretty good. It's well-written if well-worn fantasy convention, but in the midst of all there is to see and do, you're likely to lose sight of your objectives for an hour or two (dozen, hundred...). Thankfully, the characters, locations, enemies, items, and quests are all highly varied (though the voice actors are not...). The music is fantastic. It's full of melody that's memorable, dynamic, and appropriate without getting in the way or wearing itself out. That's no small feat for a game one can easily put 200 or more hours in.  Aside from the occasional repetition of faces and frequent repetition of voices, there's little to criticize if you enjoy much freedom and the natural, but often missing, effects of it. Eventually you'd be able to enchant items, mix potions, and even create custom spells and you'll grow your skills by performing them. Want to run faster? Run. Be a better healer? Cast some restoration spells. When enough of your main skills are leveled you can rest and level up and grow stronger. This progression can be exploited if you wish, and many late game abilities with the right items will make things easy, but there's a difficulty slider you can change at any time.  And if there happens to be anything else you don't like, chances are someone's made a mod to improve/remove it. This series has an exceptional modding community and Morrowind is no exception.  If you want to get lost, for fun, it's hard for me to think of a better way to do it.",2015-07-23

Rejoice!,"Now that the mighty GFWL dragon has been slayed, I can state without any hesitation that Dirt 3 is absolutely 100% worth buying.  The Steamworks version comes complete with a graphics overhaul (it's a gorgeous game), all the previously released DLC, steam trading cards and achievements.  If you owned the GFWL version, the updated version should have automatically appeared in your Steam library.<br /><br />The actual driving and gameplay is where Dirt 3 really shines.  Cars have rarely felt better and handled better.  Whether its driving over desert sands or arctic snows, the cars just feel so, so good.  If you spin out, it's your fault.  Sure, you'll occasionally have an AI driver spin you out, but the races are generally so short that starting over isn't that big of deal (yes, you can rewind, but let's just call that what it is - cheating).<br /><br />That's not to say, however, that this game doesn't require any skill.  It absolutely does.  You'll be clenching various body muscles and you corner around hairpin turns, race full throttle down a mountainside, or drift around a corner.<br /><br />The only drawback - and this seems to be common with all racing games - is the &#34;bro dude&#34; way your team managers speak to you.  I honestly don't know why developers think this is a good idea.  It's completely ridiculous when bro dude says, &#34;Mucho grande gymkhana!&#34;  The average gamer is a 30-something, well-educated male.  We don't speak &#34;bro dude.&#34;  Honestly, it's a bit insulting, but whatever.  Just tune them out and you'll be ok.<br /><br />I can't highly recommend this game enough for the great visuals, car handling and straight-up fun.",2015-07-23

It is $15 bucks after all I am very satisfied with my purchase. The only difference between the regular and special edition is that you get extra robes that give you certain features. Honestly, I think it's not worth the extra $5, I mean the robe isn't that great.<br /><br />I loved the game, I enjoyed it with my boyfriend and it was everything a couch co-op game should be. Loved the characters and it's just really silly and a lot of fun. The only hard part for me was memorizing all the codes/formulas to use for attacks. Really sad we finished game quickly but once you're done, you can customize the game with unlocks you've earned and replay it.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this game, it's a fun game :)",2015-07-23

Well, that effect quickly wore off. After about three weeks or so, people started unlocking &#34;Elite&#34; variants of guns in supply drops which completely ruined the game. The variants were so incredibly overpowered it was extremely frustrating to play. Now, with the addition of advanced supply drops, once again in a FPS, people can buy their way to the top. The number of overpowered weapons skyrocketed and now every time I get killed, it is in like one second by an overpowered gun. Exo movement was fun at first but it is now extremely annoying.

4086,US,40788541,R2RSWV40G32VXR,B00LF4GZLI,N,N,A little rough around the edges but fun!,"Thank you Aterdux Entertainment for sending us a review code for this game!<br /><br />In May of 2012 Legends of Eisenwald was successfully funded on Kickstarter with nearly $84,000 raised.  Since its funding, it has been beta tested by the backers and greenlit on Steam.  Nearly three years later it's now available for everyone to enjoy.  Gamers who like 3D RPG tactical strategy games like King's Bounty will find much to like in this title.<br /><br />Legends of Eisenwald begins with a choice of a character to play.  There's a slightly different story for a sword wielding knight, a cunning baroness that is good with a bow, or a mystic who is an expert in alchemy.  The mystic is the hardest class to play and is recommended for seasoned gamers.<br /><br />No matter what class you play, you will be at a disadvantage in each of the eight chapters in this game.  You'll only have a couple of soldiers, if any, at the beginning of each chapter.  Most of the inventory gets reset too.  The number of soldiers in your army maxes out at twelve, but in order to have that many soldiers, you need to have a couple of castles under your control.  Before you can besiege a castle, you'll need to have a decent army at your command.<br /><br />Most towns have villagers willing to join your cause for a meager fee.  They're inexperienced, but trainable to become powerful knights and archers.  Healers and priests can be hired at Christian churches and pagan temples.  If you have money to spare,  experienced mercenaries can be hired for a daily fee at taverns and mercenary camps.<br /><br />Money in this game can be earned by completing side quests, collecting taxes from property under your control, or defeating and looting the local enemy armies.  Each area has its own local lore and  rumors that can be learned by stopping at taverns and talking to people.  Many treasures are waiting to be claimed by brave soldiers willing to search for them.  They are often guarded by protective spirits though.<br /><br />The battles are turn based and the units are placed in hexagons and can attack nearby opponents if they are melee fighters or longer ranged if using archery or magic-based attacks.  The battles can be fought manually or auto-resolved if you're in a hurry or lazy like me.  Armies with undead spirits need to be defeated by magic users who can harm them since physical attacks against them are useless.<br /><br />Many, but not all of the side quests have unlockable Steam achievements for completing them.  There are other Steam benefits including cloud saves, trading cards, and Steam workshop contributions.  Not all of the contributions are fully translated into English though.<br /><br />The development team, Aterdux, is located in Belarus and I have noticed that some of the text was still in Russian.  Some of the dialogue boxes, especially during a gambling card game, were completely blank.  Unfortunately, there isn't any voice acting so text is crucial to understanding what is going on.  The background music is top notch and worth the extra money for the soundtrack and art book.<br /><br />Graphically, Legends of Eisenwald is very pretty.  The characters and army units are nicely detailed, but are noticeably recycled throughout the game.  I was taken aback when I was conversing with a female thief who was identical to a castle baroness I was talking with a few minutes prior.  At the very least they should be wearing different clothes!<br /><br />There's a wide variety of terrain and your army will often stay on the paths, but there are many instances where you'll have to stay off of them.  When walking around mountains and forests, the cross-able terrain is not very obvious.  To make matters worse, there are some quests that require traveling to a specific pixel in order to progress.  These quests can be frustrating, but fortunately they are few and far between the in-depth story arcs.<br /><br />The lore in the game is well written and it's fun to gain power throughout the land while fleeing from enemies who can easily defeat you.  Alliances will be made and broken and there are multiple paths available to achieve the same goal.  The Catholic church has a lot of power in this game and I often visited their chapels for healing my wounded army units.<br /><br />Sadly, the Catholic church is depicted as greedy and power hungry.  Other religions including pagans and devil worshipers are also represented and required to interact with to progress the story.  Since there are battles with the undead,  violence is a given and necromancy is unavoidable.<br /><br />Taverns are the place to go for alcohol and rumors.  Some of the rumors discuss incestuous relationships and other adult situations.  Last but not least, there is some language and blasphemy.  While Legends of Eisenwald hasn't been rated by ESRB, I would only recommend it teens or older.<br />Despite the rough edges and objectionable content, Legends of Eisenwald is a great game that mature gamers should look into if they like tactical role playing games.  The entry fee of $29.99 is reasonable considering that there is fifty plus hours of gameplay to enjoy.  Those who have pre-ordered or kickstarted the game, not only got it for a better price, they were also given a free copy of Discord Times which was the developer's first game.  I'll definitely be keeping Arterdux Entertainment on my radar and look forward to more games from them.in power throughout the land while fleeing from enemies who can easily defeat you.

So far this one (Black Flag) is my favorite in the series.  Black Flag is actually one of my favorite games all around.  I've logged 72 hours so far with this and I'm around 75% done (I am a completionist and have to search every nook and cranny of the open world).  Unlike my previous experience with the AC games, in Black Flag you are not actually an assassin, but a budding pirate that can also do assassin contracts.  This is awesome!  You can spend as long as you want on land or at sea, with missions to complete in both places.  Other then some random game freezes, I've had no problems with this game.  When it has froze (on Windows 8.1) I have to do CTRL-ALT-DEL and sign out of the PC and then sign back in & open everything back up.  The freeze will not allow me to view the desktop, so its either sign out/sign in or reboot the PC.  Luckily I have not lost more than a few minutes of gameplay when this happens.<br /><br />The game requires a free UPlay account (even the Steam version requires you to also have the UPlay software) and defaults your saved games to the cloud.

4123,US,50820219,R1LOAR5C6KTROK,B00HQNYMQ2,N,N,"Back to ID's best Basics, but Underwhelming at the End.","Wolfenstein: The New Order does do one thing very well, it makes killing Nazis fun again in a video game. It also brings back an elements from the old days of ID software made possible by Machine Games. So what‚Äôs the hook for this game? Well, the Nazi‚Äôs won WWII, hence the title and boy has the world changed. After the prologue and a very tragic choice, you find yourself back in the beefcake-nazi-stabbing shoes of BJ Blazkowicz, but in the 1960s. The world has been molded into a very Nazi wonderland landscape reeking of clich&eacute; fascist imagery with science fiction flare. Almost reminiscent to ‚ÄòHalf Life 2‚Äô or ‚ÄòDishonored‚Äôs‚Äô city landscapes. Of course you mostly play through the game from I would say from the European side of the resistance conflict and you have to gather rumors and newspaper clippings of what happened to the rest of the world. If you are a fan of alternate history science fiction, then this might be up your ally.<br /><br />But ultimately, is that why it received such high praise a year ago? Is that why we see 9/10 from Polygon or 8/10 from other websites? More than likely these guys were indulged with the New Order‚Äôs breath of fresh yet nostalgic air. Hell, it was great duel wielding any weapon in a video game for me. It was also great to actually have the opportunity to go stealth and perform knife stabbing fatalities to your Nazi victims in an usual guns blazing FPS franchise. So to push the narrative more, Machine Games showcases The New Order with something like a Quentin Tarantino-ish fashion in story cut scenes...and here is the disconnect for me.<br /><br />While I did play it all the way through and stated ‚Äúwell, this is fun,‚Äù I had too many ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it!?‚Äù moments. I guess I was hoping for a complete bonkers ‚ÄòInglorious Basterds‚Äô the video game based on the trailers this game had. Even the Old Blood stand-alone DLC so far even fails at reaching that point which stinks. Personally, the game decides to take itself too seriously that it becomes a little bit too campy or clich&eacute;d. Anytime BJ was mumbling in his head, I rolled my eyes and wished something bat crap insane would happen along the lines of Hugo Stigglitz. yes I know, it's a FPS shooter, but if they are going to force story down our throats, then why can't the brutal killing Nazi imagery keep steady like my framerate. Well, there was one part involving a urinal, but there wasn‚Äôt near enough of those moments to satisfy my apparently psychotic needs. It was during the last sections of the game where things felt underwhelming. Things started to feel like a chore for advancing through wave after wave of the obligatory shotgun armored baddies. Instead of having these moments challenging yet fun, I ended up sighing as I had to keep running away in search of armor and weapon pickups rather than be the action badass I wanted to be. I played on the normal difficulty and randomly the game amps up the ridiculous difficulty when those guys notice you.<br /><br />While I had fun playing parts either stealthy stabbing or duel wielding guns blazing, I couldn‚Äôt help but want more out of this at the end. The ending of this piece is an obligatory sequel bait with a ‚Äúdid he or didn‚Äôt he‚Äù clich&eacute;. From what I read, the choice you make for the main game‚Äôs timeline literally has zero impact on the campaign or the ending. I could play it again to talk to a different survivor and use the lock picking gimmick with that version, but that's not enough. There wasn't &#34;that one level&#34; in the campagin resulting me having so much fun I can't wait to play again, not even to collect all of the enigma codes to unlock...something. I‚Äôll admit that this has been the best Wolfenstien to come out in a long time and it‚Äôs probably one of the most solid single player FPS to be released in the last few years, but it became just a little too underwhelming.<br /><br />Oh yeah, there was no dedicated rocket launcher! Yes, I know you wield a launcher attachment to your assault rifle, but it's not the same!ifle, but it's not the same!",2015-07-22

4158,US,11337944,R1FQS8NLPJUAPZ,B00CMSCV4Q,N,Y,It's better than Elder Scrolls Online.... But that's it.,"Character Creation/Customization: Actually VERY limited. Visually refined, but limited in scope more so than games much, much older than it. Strong limitations around what facial features and hair can be used with which face type, of which there are very few to choose from anyway.<br /><br />The races in this game are: humans, humans with cat ears/tails, humans with some patches of dragon scales/horns, large and awkward pastel-skin colored people with weirdly angular but otherwise human facial features, elves who are almost identical to humans except for their weirdly horizontal ears and the pear-shaped race of perpetual human-looking children. SO, nothing very cool, nothing that looks savage, nothing that looks aggressive or fierce. No orcs or trolls or ogres or goblins or fun races. And you need to buy the xpac for the dragon scale humans. There is no second faction to this game. Although the enemy faction in the story line has all the lasers, high-tech robotic armor and space ships you spend the whole game wishing you could play with. Pretty disappointing to me.<br /><br />Class/Job system:<br />All classes exist on one character in this game. So you only need to think of one name. Good if you have only one main name you like to use in games. Bad if you like to play different races or if you like to name your character something clever and related to their class as your sneaky ninja name or whatever will not be quite so clever when you are playing a white mage or bard, for example. I fall in to the latter category, so I am not much of a fan of all the extra clutter this system dumps in your bags. All classes move at a snails pace compared to other MMO games so it doesn't really matter what you pick, you can always change and if there is any sense of satisfaction to be had playing your class, you wont experience it in the first 40+ levels anyway.<br /><br />The map and navigation:<br />All I can say here is, if your class or main story line quests turn red becauseyou are too low level and need to come back later, MAKE A NOTE OF WHERE YOU ARE because the game will give you no guidance in getting back on to your main story line. Wandering aimlessly will be the best you can do and it has happened to me several times already so, be prepared for the worst navigation experience in any MMO to date. They really spent no time on their map/mini map and it shows. The map in this game is not really a true MMO map. They are small zones, stitched together by loading screens to make larger zones, this is even true in the cities. I don't care for this personally, I much prefer a (mostly) seamless world and this game has more seams holding it together than even Star Wars The Old Republic. At least Star wars' maps were different planets so there was a defensible excuse for them to be separated by loading screens. This game does not have that excuse. And it separates it's maps a lot more than SWTOR.<br /><br />Mounts in this game are both highly detailed and in some cases HUGE (the expansions flying mounts have been pretty impressive so far). However, they are slow. Very, very, very slow. I can't stand how painfully slow travelling in this game is. It pretty much forces me to spend my character's money to just teleport to the nearest town first wherever I go. They could double the current speed of ground mounts and they might feel like an actual mount but as is, nothing you ride on, be it chicken or dragon, will make you move faster on the ground than your own sprint button that you get at level one. I think they just want to make their really, really tiny world seem less really, really tiny. They failed.<br /><br />UI:<br />The user interface is fairly customization-rich, nothing new or fancy, a lot like the game RIFT with regards to being able to move stuff where you want it or shrink it to your liking. Mini map is worthless, I just shrink the main map down to a size I like then drag it over the useless mini map and leave it there for navigation. It is my understanding that FFXIV was meant to have 3rd party add-on support by now, but their developers are basically just ignoring everyone and not adding it to the game, so there is no damage meters and consequently no way to know if you are doing well or not. Because of no 3rd party add-on support, there is no way to change your UI completely if you don't like what they offer within the game itself.<br /><br />For PS4, you CAN use a keyboard and mouse to play the game but you can NOT use any special mice with more than left click, right click, middle click. No 12 button gaming mice, not even 5 button gaming mice. For me, that might as well have meant you can't use a keyboard/mouse on PS4 at all. I bought a PC license for my account as soon as I realized that as i have 30 buttons on my bar by level 40 and there is no way I can play at a competitive level without at least a 12 button mouse. For me, I play well with the 1-5 hot keys but I don't play well holding shift/ctrl modifier keys and pushing the 6-0 keys. Because of that, a gaming mouse is pretty much mandatory for me. And because of that, playing on PC became mandatory for me. That said, because PS4 and PC characters/accounts already exist on the same servers, it was a simple task to buy a PC copy of the game in order to allow myself to log in and play on the same account from PC or PS4 at my leisure.<br /><br />Playing with the PS4 controller was a joke. Once I had more than 8 buttons, the PS4 controller was like trying to reinvent the wheel just so they could say &#34;yes it can be played on a controller&#34;. No it really can't, and even if you beg to differ, you can't argue that in a competitive end-game environment, you would benefit MORE from having to cycle between 16-button bars rather than having all your buttons/cooldowns where you can see them at all times as is the case only with mouse/keyboard mode.<br /><br />Crafting:<br />Crafting in this game is the most convoluted nightmare of anygame I have ever played, MMO or not. I hate it and I can not bring myself to say anything nice about it. There is more mechanically involved in crafting than there is in combat. Why? I don't know but this game comes off as a serious role-players wet dream and in no way does it feel like a hardcore raider or otherwise professional/dedicated MMO player's game of choice. It was interesting for the first few levels, but as the entire crafting process was brought to light, it quickly became something that I was fully committed to never wasting time on again.<br /><br />Questing/Leveling:<br />The most tedious leveling experience of any and every MMO on the market today, in my opinion. More of a chore than anything, the experience itself involves less physical combat and more running back and forth and teleporting across the map to run back and forth than any other MMO I have ever played. There is really so little actual content to this that I was stunned to see how little of my questing experience involved being more than a delivery boy for letters and introductions....and pretzels...and lemonade...and cookies..etc. etc. etc. This remains true as I approach the end of the core game. I will have to do a bit of research to figure out whether or not this experience changes in the expansion as I have little interest in doing this for 10 more levels after I hit 50.<br /><br />Combat:<br />SOOOOO SLOOOOOW. I read forums everywhere to figure out what the fastest-paced combat in the game was after rolling thaumaturge proved to be better for making me sleepy than excited. I was told every single time to try Ninja, roll Ninja, play Ninja. So I did. Ninja is just as painfully slow, even now as I approach level 50, I doubt I will play this game once it calls for another $15 unless the expansion completely changes the dynamic of combat. This game has the slowest combat of any MMO that I have ever played. I am used to global cooldowns in between button presses that are .5-1 second. This game is 2.5-3 seconds. That is just painfully slow. And no effort was made to make sure that you unlock abilities in an order that makes your combat rotation more fulfilling and rewarding before you reach the endgame for any class. So, boring is the name of the game it seems. There are lots of bright attack/spell animations, so what you get in exchange for a zero challenge/zero skill game play experience is, at the very least, a visually pretty gaming experience.<br /><br />Player Interactions/Group Content:<br />The inability to pick your own server makes this the only MMO game that tries to forcibly prevent you from playing with your friends. Character creation can, at times, take more than 24 hours as you wait for the game to momentarily (and I mean momentarily, it will be gone again in 3 minutes or less) unlock the server your friends are on. It was well over 30 hours before the server that I created my character on was randomly and momentarily available for others to join me with the characters they were making. That is absurd, in my opinion, and pointless as it's intended function was, by their own admission, to spread server populations evenly.. which did not happen at all. People say the best bet is to make your character in the wee hours of the morning at like 3am, when more servers are unlocked for use due to the low population in the middle of the night...I did not find this to have any impact on server availability for those of us trying to get onto the same server together when we tried. It was also recommended to try right after maintenance since everyone would still be logging back on and so server pop would be at its lowest making most/all servers available...Again, not my experience. The whole ordeal left a pretty bad taste in my mouth regarding the decision to use a system like this in a game that thrives off of working together and playing with friends. I really couldn't grasp why an MMO would shoot itself in the foot this way, but they stand by their mistake to this day, so expect to run in to these issues if you are looking to start the game with a friend. Were it not for this feature, my review would have been 3 stars. But this is an unforgivable error in an MMORPG.<br /><br />Environment/Graphics/NPC&Mob design:<br />Very high quality graphics, but half the creatures are just...really, really, incredibly stupid looking. Walking mushrooms and giant ladybugs and the like. And I don't mean just entry level mobs but 30-40 levels later these stupid throwaway mobs still make up the majority of those that you encounter in the world. All MMOs have this in some amount, I know, but this game just dropped the ball. There are some really cool, well-detailed monsters that are fit for titles like Monster Hunter, but they are so few and far between that it feels like very little effort went in to the artistic design of this game.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />If for no other reason than the company that is running it is not Zenimax, this game is still worlds better than Elder Scrolls Online. I seriously hate the company behind ESO, and their cash grabbing ways. Even at $15/mo this game is a better deal than ESO will ever be. I will say that I have been impressed by the community in this game, too. Somewhere between the need to pay to play with this community and the way the game was designed to incentivize positive group interactions in dungeons with the player commendation system, this game managed to breed a much more pleasant community than non-subscription based MMOs have. And even better than the toxic communities of other subscription MMOs like WoW as well. How long that sense of community lasts, I can not say, but there are still rotten players in the game. It is in no way a perfectly serene human interaction environment. Just much, much better than most right now.<br />Unfortunately that is not enough to make this game worth a continued sub fee. At the end of the day, this game does SEEM feature rich, butI will probably never be introduced to most of those features before the sluggishness and general absence of a coherent system to make that introduction leaves me bored or pushes me away with its unrewarding combat and tedious navigation experience.<br /><br />If visuals are the absolute only thing you care about, you might like this game. If you are a seasoned MMO player, you will likely not find the game play in FFXIV to be better/more rewarding than that of WoW/SWTOR/Rift. At least the game works when you play it. That is to say, no broken quests or issues that go unsolved for weeks or longer at a time. Which is not something Elder Scrolls Online can say.<br /><br />If my opinion changes at all once I knock out these last couple of levels and hit the point where I need to buy the expansion pack or be done, I will try to remember to post an update here.",2015-07-22
4159,US,53090127,R1GNHXSQ6G804O,B00GMTKMHY,N,N,Hugely better than the main game.,"I normally don't buy DLC for content. Invariably they're either set too difficult (typically only hard-core fans buy DLC, and they want a challenge), or don't add much to the story or single player experience. But my recent play-through of Max Payne 3 made me long for more Naughty Dog content, and that in combination with a recent sale that allowed you to buy Left Behind as a standalone on the PS4 game at $5 allowed me the indulgence of the DLC.<br /><br />My previous year's review of The Last of Us was ambivalent at best. But some of the most scintillating moments of the game was when I was playing as Ellie, the character Joel was tasked with protecting. (At the end of The Last of Us, we finally realize that rather than Joel saving Ellie, the game was about Ellie saving Joel) In the entirety of Left Behind, you get to play as Ellie. The story composed of two separate sections, each alternating with the other. In the opening sequence, you open with Ellie desperately trying to find supplies while Joel is incapacitated (this isn't much of a spoiler). In the flashback, you play Ellie before she meets Joel about the events that lead up to her ultimate need to be transported.<br /><br />The two stories intertwine and alternate, and reinforce each other. More than anything else, what Left Behind oozes is self-confidence. What other game would provide a good half hour of &#34;game play&#34; where you're two kids fooling around in a deserted post-apocalyptic mall where there's no way to fail, but isn't a tutorial? This is video-game storytelling at its finest, with you building and discerning the relationship between characters directly through interaction. The game isn't handed, and the lack of consequence of failure actually frees the player to enjoy the contrast with the main storyline's seriousness.<br /><br />The serious game play is well done, and arguably much better than in the main version of The Last of Us. Ellie gets to play the zombies and clickers against the party that's hunting for her, and intelligent play can be used to great effect. I still died a couple of times, but unlike in the original game, I never felt it was unfair or I was misled. The amount of stuff I could scavenge still felt parsimonious (despite playing the game set on easy), and I still felt like I was being forced to atone for being a rat-bastard DM, but twice I managed to get the Zombies to prey on the Bad Guys was far more satisfying than the grinding I had to do in the original game.<br /><br />The other interesting to note is that I played the original game on the PS3, but Left Behind on the PS4. (There's no save game state that carries over between the two, so it's OK to play that way) The PS4 version of the game is significantly faster to load and start, and also has better models, but not so much so that I'd forgo the game on the PS3. In fact, I'd say that by far the most important feature of the game is instant resume, which I love given that I often get interrupted and have to turn off the PS4 to do something else before coming back a day or so later. (I also have the PS4 hooked up to a 5.1 surround sound system rather than merely stereo, and that also makes it impressive, but the PS3 would also happily hook up to a 5.1 surround system as well)<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the full emotional impact of the DLC can really be felt after you've played The Last of Us (though I'd say that the promotional material overstates the spoilers in Left Behind: you can safely play it the minute you get Ellie as a playable character in The Last of Us, and in fact, it's probably best played that way), but if you've already played The Last of Us, Left Behind will leave you feeling even more impressed than at the end of the original game. Highly recommended.<br /><br />NOTE: if you have a PS4 and haven't played The Last of Us, Amazon sells it in digital release for $14.45. The full game includes this DLC, which is a bargain if you have never played it before.",2015-07-22

The expansions, however, were like diving headfirst into a whirlpool.

4237,US,17119551,R3TBCPH9PAC9OE,B00I0E03QO,N,N,Best MX game I've played there but still room for improvement....,"Although this game has a few flaws it's still the best motorcross game I've ever played. MXGP is not a game where you pull off insane tricks or jump off giant cliffs. MXGP is a recreation of real MX racing and it does this fairly well.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+ There are multiple game types - Instant race, Grand Prix, Championship season, Career Mode and Time attack. It has recreated tracks from real tracks on the MX tour. The tracks also have track deformation of the dirt and mud. There seams to be a lot of tracks as well. I'm not real far into it but the season I'm in has at least a dozen to complete.<br /><br />+ Multiple difficulties that can be tweaked to make MXGP as easy/arcade or Hard/Simulation as you prefer.<br /><br />+ The physics and handling of the motorcycles are done very well. No other MX game has gotten this close to the feeling of riding a real MX bike. (yes I have ridden on real MX bikes and street bikes as well)<br /><br />+The replays look good and have multiple options like slow motion, pause and a free cam. You can get some nice screenshots.<br /><br />+ Graphics are solid. The riders and the bikes look good and gather dirt and mud on them during the race. The tracks are pretty good too but could have been done better. I use SweetFX on this game and it makes it look better.<br /><br />+You can remap the controls on the controller. I recommend you use a controller. I don't know of any racing game that work well with mouse and keyboard. At least not for me. I recommend that you change the lean forward and backwards to the same stick as steering left and right. It feels much more natural this way.<br /><br />+You level up, unlock pictures, gear, bikes ect and you get more fans the better you do in each race. Also there is a simulated email and twitter type media in the game that makes tyou feel you are being watched by teams, fans and your manager. It's a nice touch to give a sense of progression and connection in the game.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The presentation is pretty bad. In between races I've had my bike disappear in the pits. The pit crew guy is working on an imaginary, invisible bike. Also before a race, during the intro scene, my rider was shaking around like he was have convultions. The pit crew and girl who holds the starting card all look and act like zombies. Why even put these in the game ? Also, Some of the ground during races has pop in and loads textures too. The game needs a patch to fix these things.<br /><br />- The sound is not very good either. The bikes just sound weak, why can't developers get this right ? Even if it's not realistic they need to alter the engine sounds to make them more rich and intense. Also, There is no option to play music during races, it would be nice to have. I noticed there is barely any sounds of the stadium surroundings happening. It would be great to have the crowd react to what is happening. Cheer when you overtake or respond to a big wreck. Make the game and the race feel exciting Milestone ! Enough with the barebones, boring presentation already !<br /><br />Also a track announcer being heard over the PA system would add some immersion. Having your pit crew tell you your doing great or you have 1 lap to go would really add some interaction to the game. These things could have be easily added into the game and would make the game better. On my PC the sound cuts in and out during start videos but no real problem in game so far. I've seen that many people have had problems in game though. Patch these things into the game Milestone.<br /><br />Overall the game just feels kind of bland. This happed in other games by Milestone. I loved the racing and handling in MotoGP 08 but it has the same bare-bones presentaion and sound as well. Milestone get the racing right, and that is what is most important, but they need to add some flavor and style into these games. As for now I will enjoy MXGP for what it is but there is definately room for improvement.",2015-07-21

4276,US,14643155,RGNND850I2VR,B00XCRT0GS,N,N,A Milestone Achievement,"I finished my first play through of The Witcher 3 right at about 100 hours with all bounty quests accomplished and a guess-timate of approximately 75 percent of side quests completed. Having completed the game once, I can say that TW3 met my expectation as it is an awesome and worthwhile addition to the open world action RPG genre. Not since the original Gothic 1 and 2, or Morrowind, did I thoroughly enjoy an open world game this much.<br /><br />The following are some aspects of the games that I'd like to discuss in further details:<br /><br />GRAPHICS/SOUND/MUSIC<br /><br />Sound is well done and appropriate. Music is very done albeit a few reused (good) soundtracks from the previous games.<br /><br />Although I am not a graphics prostitute, I readily admit that good graphics can certainly enhance gameplay and boost the total experience - and The Witcher 3 has graphics in spade. The game is simply beautiful to look at on the high settings that I run on my mid-range PC. In brief, TW3's combination of excellent graphics, sound, and music makes it an exquisite game to begin with.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY (Combat, Leveling, and Exploration)<br /><br />The combat system of TW2 and TW3 is inspired by Batman: Arkham Asylum (along with TW3's witcher's sense), which is a very good thing. Granted, The Witcher's combat system never reach the level of Batman's, but TW3 did a very good job overall.<br /><br />In comparison with TW2, TW3's combat is noticeably improved. The slight delay in elapsed time that occurs when one presses a button and the actual sword swing that follows in TW2 (that some complained about) is almost non-existent here. The action is more instantaneous. The upside is that combat is now more dynamic and happens at a faster pace, thus make it more fun and intense. The downside is that it does make button mashing easier since timing is not as critical as in TW2. However, be mindful that straight up button mashing will not get far since enemy AI is improved (eg. monster dodge quicker, human parry and counter attack more often). In addition, signs are now more integral to combat than ever before.<br /><br />In terms of difficulty, the developer CDPR made a drastic change from TW2; that is, TW3 now has a story mode difficulty for a wider audience, namely those who just like to think that they are gamers without ever having to prove it. Fortunately, the higher difficulty levels put the challenge back to the game. I recommend playing the first area on medium difficulty to get better gears, and then change to hard or even higher after that to aprreciate the full challenge and benefit of being a witcher where the combination of magical signs, potion, and bomb are essential in addtion to swordplay.<br /><br />In level up, TW3's skilltree has changed from TW2. There is now less skills that can be used at once, but it is now more versatile since you have a greater freedom of customization where various skills can be switched in and out to accommodate a specific situation or enemy.<br /><br />Exploration, the highlight of every open world game in my opinion, is extremely well done here. Horseback riding (but not horseback fighting) is well integrated into the game and make exploration an enjoyable experience. Adding a well-detailed and lively world along with great graphics, sound, and music into the mix and TW3's exploration becomes much more than a trait of an open world game; it is a wondrous expereince to behold to the point where I can totally lose myself mentally in the game and enjoy every moment of being lost.<br /><br />STORY AND DIALOGS<br /><br />Upon learning that TW3 will be an open world game a long time ago in a discussion with another veteran gamer, I expressed my concern that it would be a difficult task to combine a tightly narrated story of The Witcher caliber with the go anywhere and do anything characteristic of an open world game. With that in mind, I think TW3's story is very good; however, unless one makes a conscious effort to concentrate on the main quest, the story element of TW3 seems less focused and less layered than the previous games due to the new open world environment and the myriad side quests involved. However, in so far as open world games go, TW3's story is still one of the best ever.<br /><br />Also, dialogs are very well written and voice acting is very good. Taking a cue from the Mass Effect series, TW3 uses in-game cutscenes to enhance narration and dialog delivery. I am not a fan of cutscene, but like the Mass Effect series, I also make an exception for TW3's cutscenes since they are very good. For those who do not like cutscene at all, know that there is an easy fix -- 'One does simply toggle on the subtitle and skip through the cutscenes.'<br /><br />Furthermore, for those who read the Andrzej Sapkowski's short stories and novels like myself, it is such a wonderful treat to see old characters making appearances in TW3 - especially the Wolf School Witchers. Moreover, although the game did a good job of bringing one of the main characters Ciri into the story, only those have read the books can really comprehend the travails that Ciri had faced, and can truly appreciate the reunion of Ciri and her loved ones.<br /><br />For the Sapkowski readers who nitpick - and I can certainly nitpick - the developer got a few important details wrong from the books (I'll share the top fews in the comment section when I have time,) but overall, all the mature themes and elements that one expects from a Witcher story - including sex and violence, of course - are here.<br /><br />DRM-FREE<br /><br />Last but not least, it's important to acknowledge that just like its predecessors, TW3 is DRM-Free !!! Once again, a big 'Thank You' to the developer CDPR (CD Projekt Red) for not treating Cutsomers as thieves, and for respecting Customers' rights to own the game that they bought and paid for - and what a great game to own TW3 is.<br /><br />Please be aware that if you purchase the digital download version of TW3 from Amazon, you will get a game code redeemable from GOG.com (not Steam - if you want the Steam DRM'ed version, you'd need to get it from Steam).  For those who don't know, GOG (Good Old Games) is an online retailer of DRM-Free digital games, whereas GOG Galaxy is the *optional* DRM-Free gaming client (similar to Steam, but DRM-Free) provided by GOG. Both GOG and GOG Galaxy are owned by CD Projekt Red, the developer of TW3.  Speaking of the GOG Galaxy game client, although the game is indeed DRM-Free, there is one thing that I think CDPR should do better in making it more clearly that it is totally optional for inattentive customers.<br /><br />Also, a thank you to the publisher WB (Warner Brother) as well. Granted, WB did screw up big time with another recent release in both quality and DRM, WB did everything right with TW3's release<br /><br />In conclusion, The Witcher 3 is an excellent open world action RPG that - although does not quite redefine the genre - does mark another milestone in achievement in terms of its first rate writing and direction. Please be aware that the game is rated 'M' for good reasons. In general, the level of sex, violence, and languages are somewhat scaled back from previous games, but they are still there. Therefore, I highly recommend the game to the mature gamers.<br /><br />As a Witcher game in the series, I give TW3 4 stars (vs. 4.5 stars for TW1 and TW2). As an open world ARPG, it's a 5-stars game.nscious effort to concentrate on the main quest, the story element of TW3 seems less focused and less layered than the previous games due to the new open world environment and the myriad side quests involved.

4288,US,21143867,R228M2L50I8YA5,B010R8DUFQ,N,N,Incredibly fun.,"Great game that's both simple and complex.<br /><br />The simplicity of it comes with hitting the ball towards the goal, pretty much any soccer (football) game really. Shooting, blocking, minimal dribbling, centering, etc. All of it is present in Rocket League.<br /><br />However, it's more involved than that. You're dealing with rocket powered cars, not a human player, so your movements need to be precise. Hitting the ball at full speed w/ rocket power will undoubtedly send the ball flying off, however, where, and how you hit it determines which direction it goes. This is where the tension comes in. Cursing yourself for missing a wide open goal because you hit the ball in the wrong spot as it bounces off the sides or the top. Learning how to properly control your car's speed and acrobatic maneuvers is key.<br /><br />There's a ton of collectables, different car bodies, decals, tires, antenna decorations, hats (yes, hats), and rocket trails. None of these collectables add or subtract stats from cars. All collectables are purely cosmetic, as for the car bodies, the only difference involves how the car interacts with the ball. The larger, bulkier bodies are better suited for defending, while the sleeker cars are better suited for striking. However, you're free to play any body in any role with little detriment to the gameplay. It just makes it a hair easier.",2015-07-21

Game play is just like on other versions.  Graphics are very good.  The fish resemble the characters in Finding Nemo.  My problem is I am stuck on level 28 (really low level) and have no clue how to finish and move on.  It is obvious from game forums that there are hundreds of levels, so, being stuck now, I wonder whether to keep trying or just give up on it.<br /><br />I several other match three games that had me stuck somewhere before completing.  I estimated the amount of time I would need to get good enough at them to continue playting, and decided that was just not worth the effort.  I'm thinking of doing the same with this.  Too bad.  It is cute and fun, but when there are no help instructions anywhere, why spend the money for just a few hours of fun?",2015-07-21

I like to have the ability to choose from 3 or 4 faces...cool! The career mode is really deep and the commentary hardly ever repeats itself! I love when my guy does the sprinkler after he knocks in that 2 foot par...sweet! The ranked matches run flawlessly, although I have been dropped to the dash maybe 100 times. I like that you can't play the masters, makes Grand Slamming a lot easier. It's also nice to be able to tie for majors without the game having a playoff hole. I enjoy that they don't acknowledge a tie at any point in any game mode...I could lose on the next hole so I think it's cool just to win without acknowledging that someone else has the same score as me. I can't wait until my created golfer reaches level 100 then I bet the game gets wayyyyy better, I'm sure a ton more features will pop up after I finish my career. I like that there is around 8 professional golfers you can use, oh, and the 8 courses that the game has is more than enough. On Tiger Woods there was a feature where you could create your team and play with your friends, I'm glad they did away with that because playing with the same people can get repetitive. I think EA out did themselves with this game, this will be the bar at which golf games are made going forward. If Rory McIlroy is playing this during his off time I bet he's having a ton of fun!

4407,US,40788541,R30DR0SVAO6L64,B00UXR9K24,N,N,"Overall, Etherium provides a mildly entertaining, if paint-by-numbers experience","Thank you Focus Home Interactive for giving us a copy of this game to review!<br /><br />In a dark & dystopian future, the three most powerful empires in the galaxy wage a bitter war over a mysterious energy source known as etherium; these mortal enemies: the totalitarian Consortium, the enigmatic Intari, and the swarming Vectide all seek to dominate this extremely rare resource by any means necessary. Adding to the tension, etherium is only briefly available for harvesting, once every thousand years, and only on six specific planets. In this far future, war and its causes haven't changed.<br /><br />Etherium is an average 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate), RTS (real time strategy) game, neither really good nor really bad. In it, players will battle for control over this coveted substance. There are two single player game modes: Conquest, and Skirmish. In Conquest, players will command one of the three factions as they fight to conquer the six planets where this resource can be found. Each planet has three sectors which must be controlled, and each faction starts off with control over one planet and a fleet. The campaign map displays the six planets, your factions technology level, and the locations of the various fleets. It also displays how many turns in the campaign are left. When the turns run out, the campaign is over, and the faction with the most victory points is declared the winner. These points are awarded based upon the number of controlled sectors, technology level, etc.<br /><br />As the campaign progresses, players will attack enemy sectors and fleets while defending their own. Sadly, each planet has only three sectors, and so there are only eighteen maps in total. The A.I.'s strategy will rarely allow its fleets to move anywhere unless the fleet is severely damaged. Given this dogged stupidity, most of the campaign will be fought over one or two planets As you may imagine, this quickly becomes repetitive as you fight over the same few maps, again and again.<br /><br />Etherium's core gameplay is fast-paced, and well balanced in a manner reminiscent of games like StarCraft. Whether in Skirmish or Conquest matches, combat usually begins in under three minutes. However, unlike StarCraft, there is precious little strategy as both sides race to expand their territory. Worse still, the A.I. is stunningly predictable. After the first few matches, it will become very apparent that your enemies have one strategy from which they will not deviate - ever. Such unswerving simplicity is disappointing, and manages to rob a great amount of potential from this title. Additionally, the game suffers from poor stability, frequently crashing to desktop, especially in Conquest mode.<br /><br />Etherium also features a multiplayer mode for up to four people. Multiplayer utilizes the same eighteen maps as Conquest, while pitting two teams, of up to two players, against one another. Sadly, getting into a multiplayer match is difficult at best due to the game's very small community. On average, players in North America will wait at least an hour, though often more, before finding an opponent.<br /><br />On a good note, the controls are responsive, and can be remapped. On a sour note, there is no guarantee that your preferences will remain after you exit. In fact, it is not uncommon to find that the controls have reset to their defaults the next time you run the game. This renders the ability to remap the controls irrelevant. And if losing your control settings wasn't bad enough, the graphics and sound settings occasionally reset as well.<br /><br />Thankfully, the game is visually appealing, with graphics that are sharp and colorful, making it easy to distinguish between most units, even when the camera is zoomed out as far as possible. The maps are well rendered but uninspiring, and more akin to RTS maps of the late 90s than those of today. But, Etherium's maps do feature a handful of weather effects, like blizzards or tornadoes, which randomly strike. These effects can be fun to watch, and sometimes even create limited tactical opportunities for players to exploit.<br /><br />Audio wise, the game's sound effects are pretty good, heightening the action, and providing appropriate feedback. Additionally, its electronic music manages to add the right amount of tension, without being over the top or terribly repetitive.<br /><br />Regarding morality, Etherium contains no occultism, sexuality, or authority issues. The factions' back stories are well done, if rather dark and dystopian. Violence is typical for a strategy game: mechanical units explode while infantry are gunned down, though without blood or gore. The most serious moral warning is from the game's numerous instances of strong language, especially the abuse of the Lord's name, which is frequently used as a curse word.<br /><br />Overall, Etherium provides a mildly entertaining, if paint-by-numbers experience. The factions are interesting, the controls are easy to learn, and the action is refreshingly fast-paced. The game can even be quite difficult at first, as players wrestle with its speed and unfamiliar controls. While it is not a bad game, for the price, there are numerous titles which do Etherium's best elements better, and often with: cleaner language, less stability issues, better maps, and a far more capable A.I. All in all, Etherium is a mixed-bag of good and bad.s, which randomly strike.

I haven't figured out all of the features yet, and there are some things that I haven't found. I bought this program for the Windows 7 Home Edition OS. I don't know if any other Operating Systems can run this program, but with the way the interface is, I was under the impression that this game only runs on Windows. I am not really sure about that since I tried to find particulars of the program but could not. The interface uses the Ribbon system popularized in Word 2007, so that is my only tip off of whether or not it is able to be played on other OSes.<br /><br />Anyway, this program contains the chess engine known as Deep Fritz 14, a board to play on, a number of different settings for the board and the pieces, a number of settings for the game itself, and some other things. It has other chess playing engines packed in, but Deep Fritz is pretty good at the game, so I really didn't do anything about changing it. As with other programs it also contains a massive database of played games. You can look up a specific game if you know the particulars, or if you are a fan of someone you can find the games they played pretty easily. Just enter the name and it will show all the games that they have a record for.<br /><br />The game also comes with a link to Playchess and a thing with Chessbase, but I don't know if either of those sites automatically give you a membership or anything like that.<br /><br />All in all, this program was worth the price.",2015-07-18

Keeps telling me there's a problem with the setup, please reinstall. So I reinstalled the game, tried again, and got the exact same result. The configuration utility has 'repair' options but they didn't help. Pretty certain it's not the computer I'm using, all the latest hardware (as of 12/14), and Windows 10 Pro (upgrade from 7 Pro). I installed the game under 7, it didn't work; reinstalled under 10, same thing. The game configuration utility recognized my build (AMD dual graphics, etc) so the computer's not an issue. My older games (except 16-bit such as AOE1, Diablo1) work under Win10, so the OS isn't an issue. I've been computing since the Commodore 64; frankly, I'm not impressed.

4757,US,1674353,R2R6WVOCV2JU0N,B00MV1FGH8,N,Y,"Great game, but many gameplay flaws","I think NBA 2k15 is a quality game compared to editions of the past.  The feature that stood out to me the most was superstar abilities.  It helped to showcase the world class abilities of the top stars.<br /><br />However, this is also one of the flaws I did not like about the game.  A player who specializes in certain kinds of shots or defensive prowess is able to get away with his special ability far too many times.  For example, fadeaways are darn near automatic for NBA players who are great at them.  Defensive players can stop almost anyone inside, even great post scorers and finishers.  Passing and ball handling got harder in this game.  Defenders can jump passing lanes when it looks like they would not before you made the pass.  Running your ball handler into defenders can deflect the ball.  Sniper passes through tiny passing lanes almost always result in turnovers when good point guards can make those passes in real life.  Once I learned to avoid these passes or drives, I cut down my turnovers but also severely limited playmaking.  Inside shots are considerably a lot harder to make when facing any kind of defensive resistance, even when you clearly have the step, air time, or position advantage against your defender.  To make matters worse, 3 pointers have almost always been easy to make in this series.  So long as your shooter gets the shot off even slightly before a defender can put his hand up by the shooting hand, you will probably make the 3.  Another negative is the ability to drive and inability to defend the drive reliably.  When I was not yet used to this 2k15 game, I hated how low IQ human players can continually try and try to cross you over or drive.  As long as he tried long enough, he had a high probability to drive past your defender.  I think that's stupid.  The fairly easy difficulty of making 3's also helps low IQ human players to have a winning chance.  It's like the game designed to help people who have low basketball IQ.  Without these said flaws in this game, I would blow out most human players because they wouldn't be able to force 3's and drives.  With these flaws, there are a lot more close games.",2015-07-17

You have to use a video camera night mode to even see where you're going, which runs out of batteries every ten seconds, LOL. So scary. They should make the game much lighter. The enemies have like two attacks, which is pitiful really. The tasks you'll be doing get no more exciting than collecting keys and fuses and unlocking the next boring area, and it's not like there are many enemies.

I mean, really, it's completely ridiculous!  But I. Can't. Stop. Playing. It.<br /><br />Here's the gist:  you're a little RC/Matchbox looking car and you play soccer.  That's it.  You're a tiny car who plays soccer.  You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4, either online with other players or with AI on your team and the opposing team.  If you play solo, you can play through a season with a certain number of other teams.  My current season is 27 games and I'm about half way through it.  I haven't tried to play online, so I can't really comment on server availability or quality.<br /><br />There's not a whole lot by way of leveling up, adding powers, etc.  It's all very basic, but if the Battlefield franchise has taught us anything, it's that more doesn't always mean better.  Sometimes all you need is the basics - a few power ups, a few outfits (want to give your car a sombrero or halo? Go for it!), a few friends and a soccer ball.<br /><br />It's free right now on the PS4 if you have a Playstation Plus account.",2015-07-15

I suck at these.<br /><br />XIIZEAL is a Vertical Shoot ‚ÄòEm Up that has some pretty crazy controls and a lot of fast paced action. I honestly haven‚Äôt played one of these since 1942 on the NES unless Resogun on the PS4 counts but that was a horizontal version.<br /><br />The aim of the game is to shoot anything that comes into sight and not be hit yourself. Available at any point in your arsenal are three different forms of shooting to blow up anything that would do you in first if you left them the chance to do so.<br /><br />The first is your standard attack with a decent firing rate. The second is basically the same thing but with a turbo setting turned on which instead creates one massive stream of energy that can‚Äôt miss even if you tried. The third and most interesting which saved me in many cases is the option to shoot horizontally. Being able to hit anything coming up beside you instead of having to let it pass while dodging its shots was awesome!<br /><br />Finally outside of the realm of streaming bullets are bombs which can be detonated to not only blow up anything coming your way, but also absorb the bullets that are flying in giving you a few seconds of reprieve. Just try not to smack into anything else as you are not invulnerable to physical contact.<br /><br />Working in the same manner as it was originally designed for back in the arcades, players have lives and tokens to keep track of. After your set of lives are used up, a message asking you if you wish to continue will appear. This message pauses the game and comes up with a counter asking for you to continue using up a token. On that note though, sorry everyone but there will be no spamming of the insert token to keep going after that last one has been used up. Instead there will need to be a careful mastery of each level and quick reflexes to not get hit my even just a stray bullet. I‚Äôll let you all know when I manage to get to that point...<br /><br />If you care for a laugh or really don‚Äôt believe me, here‚Äôs how bad I really am at these (editor's note: I admit, I plan to have a bit of a laugh at PY's expense).<br /><br />XIIZEAL is a fun and quick paced Shoot ‚ÄòEm Up with solid controls that is easy to spend a lot of time on while continuously improving yourself. Now I just need to get better at these!...<br /><br />If you care for a laugh or really don‚Äôt believe me, here‚Äôs how bad I really am at these (editor's note: I admit, I plan to have a bit of a laugh at PY's expense).<br /><br />XIIZEAL is a fun and quick paced Shoot ‚ÄòEm Up with solid controls that is easy to spend a lot of time on while continuously improving yourself.

I can't tell you how often I longingly looked at it in a store, only to say 'I will get it soon, there will be  a promotion, be patient as you save up for your ps4' [it also led me to conclude that this is the game that will never go on sale.  ever.] [which i finally just went all in on just to get bloodborne lol]   I am so underwhelmed and disappointed. I thought after the opening movie, 'this will be great!'  oh, how wrong I was.   Everyone said I should play it, that it would be awesome.  Maybe that impacted my expectations.  I felt like I was playing the walking dead meets uncharted. So here are my complaints: 1. Not realistic.  Everyone said it would be.  Sure, you can die easily--that's realistic.  But enemies never run out of bullets.  Never. And you can't hold much [but you can hold an inexhaustible supply of collectibles.] 2. Joel has a magic super mutant hearing ability that lets him see around corners.  and through space and time. 3. The relationship between joel and the little girl is predictable and boring.  Maybe it's because i play so much silent hill.  I wanted something different.  and if you've watched the walking dead i swear some of this stuff was copied. why not be UNpredictable and have him be a guy trying to like survive.  or a weak guy.  or something a little bit more imperfect and human with more growth.  maybe he could actually be a screw up, making bad choices left and right.  or something more interesting.  not rambo. 4. battle system is straight forward and incredibly boring.  just shoot, run, or sneak up on someone.  oh, and joel has super strength he can bash anyone's head against a wall 5. I really did not [again] want to see a bad game like uncharted reborn in a new form Why I didn't give it one star: 1. It was nice to see a female character that wasn't overly sexualized. no loli [bc of her age] no weirdness.  it was nice. 2. Nice graphics--but at thispoint [and let's be honest] lots of games have good graphics and i kinda wonder if its just to make up for lack of creativity and plot these days i play my DS more than I play my consoles these days  I really find it strange that people say that I am being too hard on this game.  They say things like 'yea, you make some points but it's still good' but think about it!  The amount of time you invest, for nothing really interesting or original.  Yea, and I agree, it is hard to find a good original game these days but maybe if we stopped settling developers would actually make good games [and not lobby IGN with lots of $$ and other places to beef up reviews because people, this is NOT the best game to come out there].  But no one will probably read this.  But if you play it and you like it, that's great.  I am just angry that my expectations were not met. At all. Sincerely--A sad girl in NH",2015-07-15

4914,US,452646,R266Y7B39M76LW,B010P3R53G,N,N,A successful transition to the PC,"I would like to start off with a quick not about the title‚Ä¶ The Hyperdimension games have some of the strangest naming conventions for their games, second only to the Kingdom Hearts franchise (Re;Birth2 is odd, but I find 358/2 Days or Birth By Sleep so bizarre I have to stare at the names to even get a sense of what is going on there), though that is a becoming an increasingly common thing in Japanese games. Some titles are getting out of hand, regardless of their medium; I mean,  come on, with titles like the recently released<br /><br />&#34;Summer-Colored High School ‚òÖ Adolescent Record ‚Äì A Summer At School On An Island Where I Contemplate How The First Day After I Transferred, I Ran Into A Childhood Friend And Was Forced To Join The Journalism Club Where While My Days As A Paparazzi Kid With Great Scoops Made Me Rather Popular Among The Girls, But Strangely My Camera Is Full Of Panty Shots, And Where My Candid Romance Is Going&#34; things are just getting out of hand. Fortunately Idea Factory has not gone that far (yet) but man, someone should really reign in the producers and directors of these games before the titles get even more out of hand.<br /><br />One thing to note before I dig into the review is that Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation is a direct sequel and it is essential that you play the first game before getting into this latest release by Idea Factory.<br /><br />With that out of the way I have to say that Re;Birth2 is certainly a stronger game than the first. While I enjoyed the first title I was not quite as attached to the overall game as I was with the direct sequel. Sisters Generation takes place three years after the end of the first title, though the way that Idea Factory presents it is clever which makes it feel like you literally end the previous game and start the first with relatively little break between the two. With a handful of new characters (as a few have been removed, like Gust and Nisa), you are tasked with combatting the evil conglomerate ASIC and along the way as NepGear you will need to rescue the core CPUs from the Gamindustri Graveyard. While I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics of the first title, Re;Birth2's seem sharper, more crisp and it certainly runs at a smoother framerate than its predecessor and that is a big win in my book. On top of the smoother framerate, the animated avatars in Sisters Generation seem cleaner and more smoothly animated than those in the other Hyperdimension games which shows that Idea Factory put a bit more time and care into their most recent release.<br /><br />For those that played the first game, or rather any Hyperdimension titles, combat, upgrading, and the Lily Rank will feel instantly familiar as it has not changed at all. I was quite pleased to just be able to pick up the game and go with it without having to relearn anything as the first game was simple enough in its turn-based combat and basic relationship-building features. The old adage &#34;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&#34; applies here and Idea Factory fortunately did not tamper with the core concepts of the series. Instead they spent the time and resources improving the voice acting which this time around was cleaner and easier to enjoy as it appears that the actors are all a bit more experienced. The background music is just as poppy as the previous titles and fits right in with the overall aesthetic, though I did find that it seemed a bit loud but a quick visit to the settings page addressed that so no real harm was done.<br /><br />Like the first game, Re;Birth2 has a strong focus on humor and fanservice and in this latest iteration I had more than a few gutbusting laughs and rewarding ‚Ä¶ imagery. One recurring theme that you can find in Re;Birth2 is the stance on piracy; simply put Idea Factory is stabbing at software piracy every turn they can get and they have some campy ways of doing things and it is simply splendid. Whomever it is that writes the contentover there is a pure genius. As a whole the Hyperdimension games tend to go through and poke fun at the various rivalries and issues in the gaming industry and it can be as subtle as a quip here or there or in the overall moral of the game and it never gets old.<br /><br />Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation is an excellent release that builds on the story and characters of the original title in a way that is both deep and fun. Using humor to address some of today's largest problems in gaming, as well as a solid focus on fairly traditional JRPG gameplay, Re;Birth2 took everything that Re;Birth gave us and does it better. It truly is how sequels should be, a continuation of a previous title with more improvements than changes. Not once did the game ever feel stale which is partially due to the increased challenge of the game as a whole (it is far more challenging than Re;Birth without being head-smashingly difficult).

4917,US,51414865,RHR9ILI1ZC0MZ,B00L3HYNBQ,N,Y,"DRM, and just not a very good game.","Imagine my surprise when I install this game‚Äîwhat appears to be a charming little indie game I had never heard of‚Äîonly to be presented with DRM despite there being zero mention of it on the product page (update: it seems they've finally disclosed this on the product page, so it's no longer misleading). Not only does the game require a serial number (which is reasonable enough by itself), but it also needs to either connect to the internet or be activated by phone the first time you launch it. That means that if I fall in love with this game when I finally get around to playing it, my future access to it is going to be dependent on some activation server somewhere out there being functional.<br /><br />Update: I just noticed that internet is listed in the system requirements. It could easily be assumed that's just there to indicate that this is a downloadable game rather than a physical one, especially given the vast difference between that and a game with Steam or Origin having this prominently listed in bold rather than being hidden away in the system requirements, but I honestly didn't see that before buying so I'm going to go ahead and consider this a mistake on my end (even though the online check and serial should really be explicitly mentioned somewhere on the game page).<br /><br />I've also finished playing through the game. It lasted me somewhere between 2 and a half to 3 hours, and it's a little puzzle-platformer with a mythological twist. The story's ending is a bit vague, but the setting is rare enough in games that I consider it a net positive. I still can't bring myself to give this game more than two stars, however, because it's simply not a good game. Nothing highlights this quite like respawning at a level checkpoint after losing all your health and being unable to jump for a few seconds. I can't even begin to describe how annoying it is to fall into a pit first thing because the game didn't let you jump. The hit detection is also a bit wonky, especially toward the end, and there's a sense of inconsistency in how things work. In one level, an eye periodically opens in the background and kills you if it sees you. To avoid this, you have to hide behind pillars and blocks. Problem is, only certain pillars and blocks hide you, and it somehow saw me even though I was completely obscured by a pillar for no reason other than it not being one of the pillars the game designated a &#34;hide behind&#34; pillar.<br /><br />Difficulty is virtually nonexistent save for that derived from the awkward controls. Tapping W floats you up (you have something like 5 flaps of your wings) and space causes you to glide, but this just feels wrong. Even toward the end of the game I found myself instinctively hitting space when I wanted to flap higher. This caused problems in the last stage, where the background throws fireballs at you that you have to shoot down while platforming. That level is the absolute worst, by the way‚Äîthe fireballs split into 3 more when hit and thus each one requires 4 precise shots (and a little luck, since the hit detection is less than ideal) to take down. On top of that, they're shot at you so frequently that you're basically forced to make your way through the stage relying on your peripheral vision to platform. There are also some miscellaneous annoyances like rams flying across the screen out of nowhere to hit you. None of this is particularly difficult so much as it's just really grating to have to put up with. To the game's credit, you don't have &#34;lives&#34; that you have to manage for fear of getting a game over and having to start over from the beginning; dying at any point plops you back at the last checkpoint you reached, and sometimes enemies who you've already dealt with don't respawn. Sometimes they do. Again, there's really not a lot of consistency, and the game feels a bit shoddy for this.<br /><br />The graphics are okay; the screenshots on the page here are definitely reflective ofhow they look in-game, with everything being aesthetically pleasing, but looking like a bunch of 3D models missing textures. This keeps the screen from being too busy through most of the game, though, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />All in all, it has some good moments, but it's just not as enjoyable as it probably should be.eing aesthetically pleasing, but looking like a bunch of 3D models missing textures.

I explained that to the support agent who was assisting me, even offered to email transcript of chat conversation via EA support, the customer agent declined, told me this is a very old game and that I am stuck with the option of using a &#34;3rd party unofficial website&#34; (their words, not mine) in order to activate an use the Single player portion after being told 2-3 different stories.<br /><br />While I do not blame Amazon for Gamespy going down, I do believe something should be done would the lack of MP support, so one can simply install, use key to activate and enjoy the single player portion as the description states, or change the description all together as it is for me at least, was somewhat misleading....<br /><br />Goes to show, even with an old golden game, one must do their research before making purchase.",2015-07-15

Electronic Arts is stealing you money and giving the bearest of s*** that they can muster to call a game. DICE is equally s***ty for partnering with them. The number of problems in this game is mind blowing and I'll hit on my favorites, if I can call them that. First of all, the hit registration in BF4 is a joke and EA wants all of your money and won't spend any on dedicated servers to fix this. Side note to that, because they don't have dedicated servers, you can only join servers that have low ping, AKA I should just go F*** myself if I happen to want to play a certain game type since there aren't as many servers. Also, since people host these servers themselves rather than EA not being little s***s, they can set whatever playstyles or game rules they want, so it's especially hard to find any consistency at all. You'd never find two of the same server, which sucks when one is dead or full of a constant one sided team as neither the game nor the independent servers have an efficient balancing system in place. I could go on but you should just do research into youtube videos about the problems of BF4 before you throw money away to EA. Ps. I hope everyone who preorders game dies b/c you're the reason that EA can get away with releasing a s*** game in the first place.

If you're considering getting into this game, take the time to watch some \\""let's play\\"" videos on youtube. The learning curve is a bit steep for newbies, even though this is arguably one of Paradox's \\""easiest\\"" games. But if you're a fan of history, you'll love features such as the in-game wikipedia links to historic figures.

This game is like Civilization on steroids.<br /><br />However, I'm going to give this game a 4-star review only for Paradox Interactive. The vanilla game (no mods or expansions) is horribly incomplete. And although the game has had a lot of great work added on to it, be prepared to shell out hundreds of dollars.

Electronic Arts is stealing you money and giving the bearest of s*** that they can muster to call a game. DICE is equally s***** for partnering with them. The number of problems in this game is mind blowing and I'll hit on my favorites, if I can call them that. First of all, the hit registration in BF4 is a joke and EA wants all of your money and won't spend any on dedicated servers to fix this. Side note to that, because they don't have dedicated servers, you can only join servers that have low ping, AKA I should just go F*** myself if I happen to want to play a certain game type since there aren't as many servers. Also, since people host these servers themselves rather than EA not being little s****, they can set whatever playstyles or game rules they want, so it's especially hard to find any consistency at all. You'd never find two of the same server, which sucks when one is dead or full of a constant one sided team as neither the game nor the independent servers have an efficient balancing system in place. I could go on but you should just do research into youtube videos about the problems of BF4 before you throw money away to EA. Ps. I hope everyone who preorders game dies b/c you're the reason that EA can get away with releasing a s*** game in the first place. Since they have your money before they even give you a game, they don't even have to try.",2015-07-15

This game pack is targeted for those who love to do outdoor activities within a limited amount of space. Like another reviewer said here about the camping ground world (Granite Falls) &#34;You can't even go swimming in the lake! Other than the scenery and new features of CAS and buy/build mode content this game is sorta bland&#34;, and I 1000% wholeheartedly agree. You cannot purchase a lot in the new world.<br /><br />This game pack is honestly a hit or miss. I personally like it for the new furniture, clothes, hairstyles, traits, party type and Granite Falls.

With the resurgence has come a dried out theme of cookie cutter designs and failed attempts, but then comes along this little gem!<br /><br />Quick synopsis, you are air dropped by a mysterious company to gather information on a rebellious group in a zombie infected city. You are now tasked with the job of running all over the city in the hope of uncovering information about the inhabitants, while also trying to discover the type of person you are. All of this while trying to stay in the light, because once the light goes out the real problems begin.<br /><br />Just like Dead Island, there are subtle RPG elements to this game. You can increase your stats and learn new abilities as you run, jump, and climb your way through a city crawling with the undead. The crafting option from Dead Island returns and has been expanded upon, which is always a nice feature, even if the weapon degrading and upkeep can be a bit tedious at times. The most interesting addition to this game is the parkour element to it. At times it feels almost cheap to be able to do it, but the fact that you can do it makes you get cocky and mess up creating even more dire situations! It's a fun element that only a handful of games have been able to deploy successfully.<br /><br />Overall it's a fun and very addictive game. Well worth the money, especially if you have a group to play with.",2015-07-15

It is annoying and they make you go back and forth through the level several times to drop off hostages ect. This was blazingly frustrating.

I played this expansion and got max level then proceeded to do what little end-game there was (Hunts are a terrible idea Squareenix ).  Besides limited pve there is pvp which is not played by many people and is clunky.  When not doing pve or pvp there is a golden saucer ( from ff7)  which is fun for a short time.  Crafting is very good but gets repetitive after a few days.  MMO's just don't have a lot to do at the end game anymore.  I played FF11 and there were 40-50 different endgame tailored events you could run your character through.  After playing FF11 most MMO's just feel bland and I grow tired of the limited things you can do with a max level character.  Wish there was deeper customization with stats and abilities after max level like in FF11 and Diablo 3.  I will probably return to this game for the next expansion or a major patch in the next year or two.,2015-07-14

One of Telltale's best.,"The Wolf Among Us is one of Telltale's greatest games. This is a game in some ways different and some ways similar to Telltale's award winning The Walking Dead. The Wolf Among Us is more of a story-driven detective game while The Walking Dead is a story-driven adventure with branching paths.<br /><br />This game definitely takes more time and attention than The Walking Dead requires. The Walking Dead takes you on the adventure and allows you to participate to enjoy the game.<br /><br />The Wolf Among Us does shove immediate interest in your face. You must choose to participate and find the interesting details and events yourself to become invested in the game world. There are many interesting minor details you have to go out of your way to notice such as reading character logs and having side conversations with NPCs that require your active involvement different from The Walking Dead easily leading players to obvious interesting aspects.<br /><br />Both games are so different. Neither is different nor better but I feel it necessary that I compare the two to adjust those who have played The Walking Dead to better understand the thought-processing behind how The Wolf Among Us plays.<br /><br />The Wolf Among Us is, in my opinion, one of Telltale's best games. The Wolf Among Us is a more articulate detective game that shares similarities with The Walking Dead. Playing The Walking Dead was like a theme park ride where you get to enjoy certain rides that take you along the adventure. Playing The Wolf Among Us is like going to a museum and looking at interesting pieces in detail and learning the history behind those museum pieces.",2015-07-14

I've used Steam for other games but not for a while so I had to update it. It updated right away and I had no problem installing it.

If you have a fast internet connection it could be done in an hour otherwise it will take a lot longer depending on the connection. This has nothing to do with Amazon and more to do with your ISP and your connection speed. The purchase through Amazon was slick and fast and cheaper than buying directly from Steam.,2015-07-14

5139,US,53090127,R2SFOEZLADHPQO,B00AR05D6O,N,N,A puzzle platformer that's actually not frustratingly painful to play,"The funny thing about PC gaming is that it's filled with deals, humble bundles, and what not. Because of those deals, I sometimes end up with games in my Steam library that I have no memory of how or why I bought them. Most of them turn out to be pretty crappy, while an occasional few turn out to be gems. Deadlight is one of the latter.<br /><br />Deadlight has two things going against it: first, it's a puzzle platformer, and I usually dislike platformers. Secondly, it's got zombies. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty much done with zombies, and that's by itself a turn-off nowadays.<br /><br />Against that, it has several things going for it. First of all, the art is gorgeous. This has to be one of the prettiest platformers I've seen. Most indie platformers for whatever reason take pains to look like retro-games from the 8-bit era, but I didn't pay for a high end video card to stare at pixelated garbage. The music is also well-executed. Far more importantly, however, is that the game's puzzles are logical. There were very few places where I couldn't think through a puzzle and figure out what I'm supposed to do. (Only 2 locations required me to youtube it, and after the reveals I did a face-palm every time) Because of this logical nature, I found myself drawn into the game, playing on and on for just one more level until I got to the end!<br /><br />The story's fun, and even justifies some of the extreme platforming. Some of the reviews on Amazon complain about the latency of the controls, and indeed there are several sections where being off by a few milliseconds would force you to restart, and you'd just have to play over and over again in order to get through it. That's not so fun. But if even I can do it, it shouldn't impose a challenge for most players. It could also be that if you have a less than capable PC, the latency could be so bad that the game's unplayable. (I played with an XBox 360 wired controller: it's entirely possible that the game is worthlesswith keyboard and mouse, since it was originally designed for the XBox 360)<br /><br />All in all, a worthy experience. There's no need to pay $15 for it though. Just get it as a humble bundle or steam sale, and don't pay more than about $5 for it. Recommended.",2015-07-13

5145,US,8978869,R2I1LRAFKI1S8D,B00WV7Q1ZI,N,N,One of the best RPG's I've ever played,"The Witcher 3 base copy I got included a user‚Äôs manual, poster of the world map, wolf stickers, a thank you note from the creators, game soundtrack, and a black pouch that contained a wolf metal key-chain; which I made into a necklace. Not to mention the 16 FREE DLC‚Äôs they will be releasing; very impressive indeed. The creators made it clear they care about my business, unlike many big AAA game companies. Anyway below is my take on the pros and cons.  *Pro's: -Huge open world, great graphics, lush vivid colors, cool crafting feature, tons of missions/quests, many unique enemies, incredible detail & textures, beautiful dynamic weather, movie style cinematic dialog exchanges, true freedom to explore, gorgeous scenery, hypnotizing music, very funny humor, lots of blood, thrilling combat with cool abilities, 36 different end-game save-states with multiple endings, and so much more. -The dialog option you select can ENTIRELY change the outcome of that particular situation, and the outcome of the story. -You don't need to have played the other Witcher titles to enjoy or understand this one, I know because this was my first Witcher game. -Game of Thrones style drama. -The music is seriously so good! -The horses are actually fast, much faster than the mounts on Dragon Age: IN. -Upgrade your horse. -Sail on a small boat. -You can save your game at any time and there's unlimited save slots. -Color blind friendly option was added/patched in. -Stash spot was added/patched in. -New game plus (NG +) feature was patched in. -Very different difficulty levels. -Vast amount of content. -The optional card game &#34;Gwent&#34; is the best mini-game within a game that I've ever played. There are 4 different playable decks with unique leader cards. It's very addictive and you can collect cards from random vendors throughout the world.  *Con's: -Enemies can either be extremely difficult or very easy. -Fall damage is bonkers, but you can press &#34;O&#34; to barrel roll as you land toreduce the damage. -You are forced to use your &#34;Witcher Senses&#34; in the majority of quests, can get a bit annoying. *Thankfully they patched in a color blind option that helps me see the red spots easier. -You will light/extinguish candles and lanterns on accident, all the time. -You can only fast travel from road signs, not a big deal but there it is.  I want to proudly add that I have NOT experienced any serious issues, glitches, or frame rate problems while playing The Witcher 3.  Overall this game is absolutely amazing and will provide tons of fun for a very long time. I normally don't support DLC, but I think people should buy The Witcher 3 Season Pass to support CD Projekt RED; they really outdid themselves and truly deserve it. Happy gaming and God Bless.",2015-07-13

5152,US,49760157,R2CE167Y35P8RW,B00N13JZB8,N,N,Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes Is Back and Better Again!,"Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games just get better and better. I have always been impressed that they listen to their fans as each subsequent game has improved. I was ecstatic when I saw Frogwares had made another Sherlock Holmes game. I thought that The Testament of Sherlock Holmes was their last hurrah and I am so glad that wasn't the case.<br /><br />Pros: -The game encompasses several cases. I have enjoyed the longer cases in previous games, but the shorter cases made it easier to wrap your mind around the mysteries, sift through/review evidence and come to your own conclusion.<br />-Getting to come to your own conclusion. In the previous games, Holmes guided you through. In these games, you ARE the detective. And you can get it wrong. Some reviews I read didn't like that Holmes could get the answer wrong, but since I am playing the game as Holmes, I like that I personally can get it wrong. It makes the game all that more intense and exciting.<br />-The files make it easy to look over all the information you have gathered. The deduction board was also an ingenious way to put the clues together. You make links between different information and evidence to form conclusions and there can be multiple conclusions.<br />-The mysteries are solvable. One thing I do not like about mystery games is when the answer comes out of nowhere and you feel that you never had a chance to solve it. These are all solvable. If you go over the clues, review evidence, reread dialogue and think about it, you can get the right answer. I got all but one of them correct. I had determined to go over all the evidence thoroughly before deciding on a final answer and that helped. But still, pressing the button to launch my conclusion always had me nervous! I looked back over all the evidence of the one mystery I solved incorrectly and realized what erroneous conclusions I had drawn. I didn't entirely agree with the answer, but that's probably just cause I got it wrong :-)<br />-In my opinion, thebest addition is the morality choices. So many times in the Holmes stories, Sherlock has to make a moral decision what to do with the criminal. He is not the police. He can decide to work outside conventional law. The morality choices were an added layer that made the game all the more real and like the Holmes stories.<br />-Two of the stories are Conan Doyle stories. I liked getting to play real stories! They were modified a little, but not enough to take away Conan Doyle's original plots. I am a Conan Doyle fan and it was so enjoyable getting to play his own stories. One was an obscure enough story that I recognized it, but didn't remember much about it and so had to figure it out along with all the others. The other I knew very well and flew through the case, but it was still fun to be in the story.<br />-The variety of the cases. I was impressed by how nothing was redundant. Each case was unique and completely held my interest.<br />-Telescope easter egg. So funny.<br /><br />Cons: -As someone who adores the Conan Doyle stories, I didn't like the characterization of Mycroft. It seems the thing these days in recreated Holmes stories and shows to make Sherlock and his brother antagonists. They just are not like this in the Conan Doyle's stories. At one point, Sherlock tells Watson in one of the Conan Doyle stories that he has gone to Mycroft at times for help. And if Mycroft were to show up asking Sherlock for help, he would not be indifferent.<br />-The characterizations of Watson and Holmes also suffer a little. Watson is turned more towards the bumbling idiot Watson which is not Conan Doyle. Sherlock is made more aloof and cold than in previous games.<br />-In one of the mysteries, a clue is worded in such a way that it can lead the player to an incorrect conclusion. I wondered if this was overlooked by the developers. I decided to ignore the wording in light of other evidence and that led me to the right answer, but I was worried it would be incorrect becauseof the clue wording.<br />-There is less freedom to explore your environment than in previous games. You don't get to &#34;explore places in London&#34; as much. The game boxes you into an area and if you wander to the edge throws the map in your face. That was a little off putting and reminded me I was playing a game. I would have rather Holmes had said something like, &#34;There is nothing interesting over there.&#34;<br />-Final screen. Once you've finished the whole game it seems like there is going to be a cut scene, but nothing happens.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful game. I am excited to see what Frogwares will create next for Sherlock Holmes since it seems that the last dialogue between Holmes and Watson teased about another one.",2015-07-13

All classes are very interesting, and while many are &#34;archetypical&#34; they usually have a nice twist to them. The combat is super fun once you reach higher level in PvE or more so in PvP/WvW. WvW looks messy at first but once you understand it, it is actually a very organized mode and can be very fun, though you sometimes end up just spending a very long time running. Some people complain about the lack of end-game content, but I think this is mostly that the end-game is just very free. The one possible problem is the lack of challenging PvE content, which hopefully will be fixed with the coming expansion.<br />Overall, hours of fun, and I'm looking forward to the expansion!",2015-07-13

There's a suitable storyline to go along with it, if you stay with it long enough somehow you might actually get to meet Cersei and the demon monkey (Tyrion) for real (their voices at least).  But most of this game so far is following along others, picking what to say, CAREFULLY, then getting in a fight and moving the mouse just so at the right time, or else you're dead and you have a do over.  The game needs a lot more on screen help at first- i don't think i should be getting killed over and over during the first five minute (4:45 of it talk) and i have no idea what i am doing wrong!  I may be a dunce at these games but to me, it is one of those games i think like &#34;Silent hunter 4&#34; that requires a learning curve you have to make time for.  Since I'm a fan of the show I want to get further into the game i think, just to meet the characters.  But I'm not sure if i'm going to get far, or if it's going to join my long list of other unplayed  games because it hasn't grabbed me yet.<br />If you prefer a grittier, more action oriented game showing life at the wall, patrolling for wildlings and good old sword fights have a look at the first &#34;&#34;G.O.T. &#34; game by Epic.

5275,US,14222166,R1Z6KRR1W37TT2,B00P1RDZJU,N,N,"Terrible control setup, difficulty spikes, got boring","I *really* thought I would love this game based upon graphics, game style, FRPG with tactics. But here is why I had to stop playing it: (1) the controls are abysmal, like truly bad, obviously a console port but with zero effort to make them even remotely acceptable, and I tries mouse and keyboard and controller. (2) Enemy turns can take forever as each guy moves. It reminds me of Codename STEAM on 3DS which suffered similar super long enemy turns. (3) There are some major difficulty spikes (level 7 is horrible) and this exacerbates #2.  (4) The 20 turn limit is really freaking stupid. I'm ok with all other tactical design choices, but artificially limiting the options with a hard turn cap is just ridiculous. (5) The cutscenes were not updated and look identical to PS3, which is ok, but not ideal.<br /><br />XCOM is one of my favorite games ever. I love Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Divinity Original Sin, many JRPG and some anima - many games and genres that would portend that I would love this game. But it was tedious, boring, and too difficult at times (and I usually play most games on hard).",2015-07-12

5287,US,47150305,RS0Y0I02434AR,B00GMTKMHY,N,N,Must Play If You Loved The Last of Us,"Having read all the reviews of how short this game is, I was reluctant to spend $14.99 but when it recently went down to $9.99 I immediately bought it. I bought the PS3 add-on version which requires The Last of Us disc. After a long download (at least an hour and a half; I just started the download and came back after a few hours) you can find it from within the menu of TLoU game as it won‚Äôt appear on your hard drive.<br /><br />I completed TLoU on normal difficulty and tried this on hard. I didn‚Äôt feel a noticeable difference in difficulty and would say that a few of the final combat sequences felt about the same as some in the main game (perhaps because at this point my combat skills have gotten pretty honed.) I took my time and participated in all conversations and other interactions not required for game completion and this game took roughly 3 hours.<br /><br />The game consists of two parallel stories, both revolving around Ellie and taking place at malls. The first is her relationship with her close friend Riley and the second is that with Joel even though he is offscreen (he is present in terms of the story but not the gameplay.) The game cuts between distant past and more recent past‚Äîwhile Ellie is still at the military boarding school and at the beginning of winter in TLoU. The Riley story is mostly walking around, playing, and talking; while you control Ellie‚Äôs character and get to engage in some interactivity, there is really no combat of the kind found in the main game. The combat comes in the second story in which Ellie undertakes a solo mission in Colorado. This second story feels like it could‚Äôve been part of the main game; it is that seamless. I thought the way the game designers edited the game was good in alternating the slower Riley story with the more action oriented Colorado mission.<br /><br />In the days following the completion of The Last of Us, I read articles and forum comments about the ending and watched YouTube videos; I simply couldn‚Äôt get enough and wish the experience could have continued. With Left Behind, I somehow felt some closure. In finishing this game, which didn‚Äôt reveal anything of great consequence, I nonetheless felt satisfied, like I can put this game away for a while. If you loved The Last of Us as I did, I highly recommend this game. Sure, it‚Äôs ten dollars for only a few hours, but I enjoyed this more than many more expensive and shorter movies at the theater.",2015-07-12

I don't really think it is a game that should be called &#34;Bioshock.&#34; It doesn't have the same feel as the first two. Where the underwater city of Rapture is dark, ominous, and you feel alone in an evil city, the floating city of Columbia has a very light atmosphere, and your companion makes you feel as a team. Your plasmids (or salts, as they are called here) are not as powerful as before, and I didn't feel the same need to use them as much as I did in Rapture. For the most part, the game was solely fought through with my gun. This feels more like an action shooter than a sci-fi horror game.

5346,US,20455759,RC5PURA4FXV52,B008XN042K,N,Y,Black Gold is back,"Great game that I originally got when it came out, but over the years lost the CD. Now it is back.<br /><br />Like others have said the AI (in Skirmish at least) is overly tough on easy mode, but in the campaign is where the entire game really shines. Tutorials are decent but leave out a few key details (such as Russian units auto-repairing) so expect a bit of on-the-field learning curve. Great thought provoker I think, especially for the time it was released. Undermarketed game when it was released, but that could have been due to the USA recently having invaded Afghanistan with Iraq not far behind. And for being a 2001 original release the graphics are amazing, dated now but looks nothing like a 2001 game. More like a 2005 game in graphics. However in the re-release I don't know if they touched up the graphics or not, been too long to remember fully.<br /><br />As for the download and install difficulties others have reported I encountered a few and here is how I resolved them:<br />1. Download was a little funky, but after a several minute delay from clicking the button it started as it was supposed to. I'm guessing all the DRM and authentication crap was slowing it down.<br />2. Install was the same, slow from my click commands but once it started there were no problems.<br />3. Starting the game. This was where I hit a real snag. A command line window appeared for a split second after clicking the launch button then disappeared and... nothing. Game never launched. So what I did is right-clicked on the desktop shortcut and went into &#34;Properties&#34; and in that went to the &#34;Compatibility&#34; tab. There, the only change I made was clicking the &#34;Run this program as an administrator&#34; check box. After that change the game popped up an initial setup window for me to select resolution levels and other graphics settings. After confirming that the game booted up smoothly and has continued to do so. The activation key the game prompted for once loaded was in the email Amazon sent me, and required no caps to get it in the boxes right (a little odd but it worked).

As many reviewers have written here, the batmobile will make or break it for you.  From my perspective, they've taken out the main boss battles and replaced them with batmobile missions...lots of them.  You can't escape it and you'd do better spending a few of your upgrades on the armor and thrusters....I did not and paid the price.    The batmobile missions are mostly all tank battles of ever increasing intensity.  The first few battles are fun and the battle graphics are great, but it becomes tedious and dull after awhile.  Not only did the car not mesh that well for me, it seemed to take me out of the flow of the game...Hats off to WB for trying something new, but I would've enjoyed just rappelling around and exploring via air.  The ground view didn't really add anything for me.  And I was disappointed to find out many of the riddler trophies also required use of the car.   The Riddler also has car races for you and you'll need to chase firefly with the car to finish that side mission.   The main story is ok but completely predictable.  Scarecrow, the main villian, sounds too much like Hugo Strange.  The Joker was excellent.  Some of the side missions lacked imagination (far cry type outposts to infiltrate and conquer) and road mine removals for the never ending tank battles, and rescuing firefighters.  Many of these sidemissions were simply the same scenario repeated with ever increasing difficulty.  Some of the better side missions add characters (deathstroke) which was a nice twist.    The fighting was great and fluid...almost too easy.  I didn't like the new medic class...seemed annoying.  I also missed the variety of bad guys as there weren't too many boss battles....nothing like Mr. Freeze, Grundy, Bane, etc.  Honestly, now that the main mission is over I'm having a difficult time finishing the side missions.  Feels like a grind and I'drather play something else.  The graphics are great, but the darkness gets to me after awhile...  I'd recommend waiting for a price drop.",2015-07-11

Rather than pure excitement and frenzied movement, this game is about anticipation and drama as you try to survive the wilderness. The game really is a whole process, as you need a hatchet to get wood to build fire, and stuff like that. You basically go around collecting stuff while trying to move through the world. Meanwhile, you have to watch out for hazards like packs of wolves.  While the game has a learning curve, it isn't nearly as punishing as a game like Dark Souls or nearly as complicated as some other games about collecting stuff. The art style is also absolutely gorgeous.  Overall, I really enjoyed this gaming experience and would recommend it to anyone that likes these big survival games or anyone that just wants a different experience instead of yet another shooter.

The game offered three different ways to go about solving a case and one could interchange them at will: the &#34;break in,&#34; (which was my favorite) which saw you breaking into safe houses and going from room to room in a top down view that was quite advanced for it's time.  You could crawl through rooms, place grenades of different types (explosive, gas, etc.), get disguises, gun-tottin' it, search for data in computers, fax machines, wall pictures, etc.  I absolutely loved how involved this was.  Then there was the &#34;chase&#34; aspect to the game.  You could tail someone in a car that ranged from an old beater Honda type to a Ferrari, but there were trade offs for each (the beater Honda type couldn't go very fast, but it wasn't conspicuous either, whereas the Ferrari could tear through a city but if you were going for subtle, a hammer would be more appropriate).  The fun came in trying to track down and capture &#34;Masterminds&#34; from each organization in order to bring their plots to a halt.  This involved going from city to city, casing buildings (as described above), tailing possible lackeys, bugging cars/buildings (which required another &#34;mini-game&#34; that was some-what challenging).  All in all, this is an OUTSTANDING classic that I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who wants an involved &#34;spy&#34; game, but can handle the pixelated 16 color graphics (but the game play is what makes this game stand out), and wants more than just a shooter with &#34;stealth mode.&#34;  A+++, 10 stars all the way.",2015-07-10

I'd compare it to the Bomberman series, not in terms of actual gameplay, but in terms of being so easy to get into yet having so much depth to master. The controls are pretty simple, but the maneuvers you can pull off are countless.  At its core, this is basically soccer, and the physics of the ball are such that what works in soccer works in this game. You even get points for clearing the ball, making saves, centering it from the wing, and getting assists. You can also &#34;head&#34; the ball along by bouncing your car and tilting it. Not that you need to like soccer to enjoy this game, but if you do you'll appreciate the influence.  There's very little fluff to this game...car mods are, from what I've seen so far, entirely cosmetic, which put success on each player's skill and tactics. But despite the simplicity of the game, the production values are high. It's got a great soundtrack, the menus are slick, and the loading screens are quick.

My experiences with WoW and Guild Wars 2 amount to nothing when compared to this game, and I haven't even played FFXIV for a whole week! I was a bit skeptical about playing a MMORPG on console, but they set up everything very well. Really enjoying the controller's functionality in the game, you can tell they spent a long time on making the controls feel comfortable for former keyboard/mouse veterans like myself. They even gave us an option to use keyboard/mouse instead of the controller if we want. Useful if I'd want to type up something quick in chat or just switch things up one day. You can tell that this game is tailored to the gamer, and I love it.<br /><br />If you're not sure about the game, ask yourself if you really want to log back into your old, forgotten WoW account just to re-live why you quit in the first place.",2015-07-10

Timing is everything here as the level keeps you constantly on your toes and has you be hyper aware much more so than the original game.<br /><br />Awesome art direction and some of the best ocean simulation as seen in Killzone 3, UC3, and BF4 this captivates the feel of the world really well and compliments the mental state Adam goes through while in the trouble he is facing.<br /><br />Characters have their own agenda and while not quite as well developed as in the main release, they are not paper thin either.

It's a recipe for chaos and it's also Rocket League.  It's a multiplayer arcade style soccer game that is a surprising hit among gamers.  It's a pretty simple game, so let's take a quick look at Rocket League in this game review.<br /><br />You compete in a stadium with up to 4 on 4 teams where you try to push a ball in to the opposing goal.  Cars have a lot of maneuverability with powersliding for control, boosting for catching up speed, jumping to reach the ball and even dodge rolling.  You use all of these moves to take control of the ball and score when you get the right chance.  There's small boost pads around the map which give you a 10% boost and then a big boost ball to max out your speed.<br /><br />There's a tutorial mode, but it's not even really necessary to run.  The game is designed to be a pick up and play fun multiplayer battle and that's exactly what it is.  It doesn't take very long to learn the controls and start bashing with other cars online.  There's also couch co-op with up to four players if you want to play locally.<br /><br />There's also an in depth season mode that's fully customizable for the single player experience.  You can setup your team with your own logo, style, and name.  Then take them into a long multi week season.<br /><br />Unlike most multiplayer games these days, there are no perks and no stat changes.  All cars and all players are evenly matched.  There are tons of unlockables, but they're all cosmetic.  The dev's intention was to keep the game balanced and this was a smart choice because the game would be way too chaotic with an excessive amount of power ups.<br /><br />Rocket League runs on Unreal Engine 3 and it really shows the diversity of the engine.  The graphics are very attractive with detailed stadiums.  Each stadium has it's own unique location and sometimes even a different time of day which keeps the variety up.  The various glow and boost effects from movement add a nice highlight to the gameplay.  The best part of the atmosphere is probably the boost sounds.  It's very thrilling to max out your speed.<br /><br />The devs spent a lot of time on the physics engine of both the cars and the ball to make the handling very accurate.  Once you learn to combine boosting, powersliding, and jumping you can gain a lot of control over your vehicle.  Sometimes it gets a little chaotic with all players constantly bashing the ball and it can be a bit difficult to take your shot the way you want it.  But that's kind of the point of the game.<br /><br />Rocket League is on Steam for $20 and it's a console exclusive to the PS4 at the same price.  It's actually cross platform between PC and PS4 which is great for increasing the player base and giving you an opportunity to play with friends on another platform.  PS Plus members can actually pick up the game for free right now, so there's no harm in trying it.  I can recommend you check the game out if you want to blow off some steam with friends online.  It's not the most amazing game and I'm not sure how much longevity the multiplayer will have, but it's definitely good for fun in small doses.

The older titles required significant fiddling around with to get them to run on a modern system. I spend a fair amount of time playing old games on my computer, so I am used to the process of forcing compatibility, but for a lot of people, this can be potentially frustrating. It was not just incompatibility that was an issue. Max Payne required unofficial patches I had to find on the internet to get the sound to work properly. While it may not be feasible to have the developer take the time and money to go back and fix their old games so they run more smoothly on newer systems, perhaps there should be a disclaimer before purchasing that there are issues. Not everyone immediately checks internet forums prior to purchasing digital games.<br /><br />As games, these titles are fantastic.

I haven't played PvP much. but the regular PvE allows for some challenges and also active dodge though GW2 is a bit more robust. Overall, the fighting style is akin to that of GW2.

5894,US,23149485,RC5B8JDCU95EV,B00XCRT0GS,N,N,Completely love the game,"Completely love the game. Huge, rich, pretty, open world that felt realistically full (not too packed, not too sparse) and alive. Story was great - felt drawn-in and attached to the characters, full of content, combat is fantastic (similar to Dark Souls, but more varied/more options and smoother). Different builds felt viable (eg magic vs sword vs alchemy). Inventory could be better. Only crashed a couple times for me, but that happens. Can run on high-ish settings (med. draw distance) with 8 GB RAM, i5 3470, GTX 760 at 1080p, 36ish fps. Addressing the 'downgrade' complaints/comments: yes, the game does not look as pretty as some of the trailers (looking at you Sword of Destiny) suggested, but it still looks quite pretty. That's not to say I'm entirely over that, I'm a bit put-out by it not looking as good as previously promised, but CDPR's CEO's response made me understand, even if I'm not entirely happy with that.

5948,US,20422,R1EPP4R80GNWNG,B00CYOHL48,N,N,my all time favorite strategy game.,"I love strategy games and have poured my fair share of hours into games such as empire earth , total war and board games like risk and a nice little game at a thrift store I found called Gettysburg. However my favorite strategy game out if them all is Civ V.<br /><br />What I love about Civilization V is how it is a very simple game to play it isn't overly complicated but at the same time very very layered with many different systems such as the skill tree or the united nations. Combat is equally as in depth different units have different uses and abilities.  Archers are better at long range combat (obviously) but are weak at close range. And on top of that units that have fought a lot will gain experience and can be upgraded. And as you further progress through time units you already have can be updated (for example an archer can be upgraded intoa rifleman) and I haven't even touched upon the vast number of units their is in this game and each different Civilization has their own unique units and attributes. And the game manages to ingeniously utilize every single aspect in the game there is no useless properties. Wonders aren't just a nice thing to have they have a variety of uses and purpose such as an xp or unit boost. And you even have great people such as Bill Gates or Mozart that can add profit or speed up building.<br /><br />I have said all I want to about Civilization 5 if you lime strategy I highly recommend it. If you like board games I recommend it as well. If you don't like video games in general I still recommend it.",2015-07-07
5949,US,41564455,RZFS6015SF56J,B00UXI36FU,N,N,Pillars of Boredom,"THE BAD: * The game has a sharp learning curve. Not in terms of combat or mechanics, but rather in terms of game lore. It simply did not make sense to me until I played enough of the game to figure out terms such as 'animancy' and read articles online to figure out what the plot was about. Many things in quests went over my head but fortunately were recorded in the journal. (Perhaps they were lost in the walls of text.) Personally I was not willing to devote the mental energy that it takes to getting a PhD to sort out the game. On a second playthrough, I realized how much I had missed the first time simply because some things hadn't made any sense. * Sometimes the characters would say things in a dialect of English that I can't understand (Welsh perhaps?). Combined with all the intensive lore, this made the game more inscrutable. * Overall once I figured out the premises behind the game, I thought they had potential, but I felt that they failed to be developed into an engaging and comprehensible story for the player character. * Combat was repetitive and uncreative. * The NPC's are boring. This is in contrast to other games of this genre where the characters are memorable and arguably one of the biggest strengths (who doesn't remember Imoen? Morrigan? Nalia?).  * It seemed as if the main subject of inter-character dialogue was whores, brothels, and skirts, and this sort of adolescent interchange seemed like a cheap way to avoid developing the characters. * While I respect that they wanted to give their backers space to (literally) write on the walls, it would have been good if they could have vetted the contributions more and disallowed things like 'lorem ipsum' or 'asjdkfaf' and only included meaningful messages. * The characters whom the Watcher can read their life story are tedious and discouraged me from clicking on any NPC. * A lot of quests and gameplay elements seemed lifted from Baldur's Gate 1 or 2 or similar games.  * Overall I felt the gameplay was tedious and boring, and more like work than a game. It lacked that 'moreish' sense that usually keeps gameplayers going for 'just one more enemy, just one more quest, just one more level'.  THE GOOD: * The text (minus the inter-character dialogue) was well written and sophisticated. * Gameplay mechanics were mostly smooth (apart from some amusing pathfinding problems and characters getting stuck in the wall) and the engine seems solid. * I felt it was a wise choice to go with artwork rather than animations. * I agree with the decision not to have character romances (I find the very weird and avoid them as much as possible); although, in retrospect, perhaps the extra effort required to put in that feature results in deeper characters. * It was a good idea to have a game backed by the individual investors.  THE DISCOMFITING: * This is a matter of taste, but I did not really like the decision to situate it in a post-medieval era which allowed for guns. It just seemed wrong to be able to equip a wizard with a giant gun. * I am now going to broach a more sensitive subject, and one that players will have varying views on, and that is the question of gaming and religious belief. While I know it is &#34;just a game&#34;, there were aspects of the storyline and main quest that were outside of my personal comfort zone for interactive fiction with respect to my own religious faith. There were also things that were just plain disturbing with respect to what the player character can do with souls. Obviously this is a personal issue, and I suppose it is one that is difficult to circumvent when the main storyline is based on reincarnation and demigods (or lack thereof, depending on who one is talking to). * I was uncomfortable with the gratuitous use of profanity and non-PG comments in unexpected places.  In sum, I don't feel the game is a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate (as it is being promoted). It does stand on its own merits as a reasonably acceptable although not fascinating game. I respect the efforts of the programming and development team to take it this far. I just think it is missing that indescribable &#34;something&#34; that elevates a blas√© piece of work to something phenomenal.",2015-07-07

5954,US,33683197,R3FGOUBR3ISAQV,B00WIOOTO4,N,N,The Wolfenstein with modern goodies,"If you like shooters then you'll love The Old Blood. It's classic Wolfenstein with modern appointments such as iron sights and a simple cover system. However, unlike most modern games, you can carry the full number of guns the game has to offer. No picking and choosing only two guns here. This game is very flexible in how you play, much like the base game The New Order. Want to be stealthy? Easily doable with the suppressed pistol and silent takedowns. Want to go in guns a blazing like Rambo? Go right ahead with dual wieldable shotguns and machine guns.<br /><br />In addition, this game is quite long for just an expansion. I clocked 8 hours on my first playthrough. You can go through more quickly than that, but you'll probably miss the conversations and letters scattered throughout the world that add the atmosphere of the game. Another thing you would probably miss are the hidden collectible gold bars and the &#34;nightmare&#34; levels which allow you to play an old Wolfenstein game within the game, Wolfenstein 3D I believe.<br /><br />Although there is no multiplayer, the campaign is a solid length and high quality that beats out most $60 shooters. Plus with the challenge maps, you'll definitely get your money's worth. And with in game challenges to unlock new perks such as faster health regen or having all hidden items marked on the map, you'll want to come back for more.

5988,US,26092705,R7G96GPCDC0H4,B007VFHGZ4,N,Y,One of the best reboots of this generation!,"The reboot of the Tomb Raider series took some unexpected turns and I had some unexpected feelings about them. All in all, it was a very solid game. It didn‚Äôt exactly know what it was and what it wanted to do, but I did know exactly who it wanted Lara Croft to be and knew exactly how to approach her as a character. At the beginning of the game, Lara is taking an expedition with her crew. The ship crashes on an island and Lara wakes up in a tomb by herself, tied up and left for dead. The feeling that I got in the first bit of the game perfectly encompasses the feeling that I got in every other mission; that no matter how awesome I think I am, I do not want to be Lara Croft. In the first 30 minutes of game-play, she goes through more than I have ever seen a main character go through in a video game, and she takes it like a man.<br /><br />The adventure aspect is overall stunning, and the gameplay is fantastic. The graphics look mind-blowing, and Lara as a character will surprise you. It‚Äôs a great game, and is arguably one of the most under-appreciated games of the generation. Overall, Tomb Raider was an excellent reboot with plenty of spine-chilling moments and is complete with a stunning main character. It will give you at least a solid 12 hours of enjoyment, and you won‚Äôt leave unsatisfied.<br /><br />Story: 12/15  Visual Appeal: 9/10<br />Characters: 12/15  Audio Appeal: 9/10<br />Gameplay: 10/15  Machanics: 7/10<br />Atmosphere: 13/15  Congruency: 8/10<br />Cost: $19.99  Worth: $24.99<br /><br />Overall: 80%",2015-07-06

Exploration involves areas that Dracula never explores in the main game and Alucard has a unique skill set for traveling the castle and solving puzzles, which mixes things up a bit. The same can't be said for weapons though. I mean the Crissaegrim's different but it's all alucard gets. The length of the campaign is short enough though that you probably won't notice. In fact, the length is probably one of the only two faults I really have with this DLC, the other being that it doesn't really add much to the story I'd consider essential.

6006,US,26092705,R30FET4776VBB5,B00JV3B5RE,N,Y,The Best Arkham of the Series,"I'd like to begin by confessing that I've never before and possibly will never again have such high hopes for a video game. Arkham Knight is the last Batman game by Rocksteady and is a direct sequel to Arkham City. For those who played Arkham Origins and were disappointed, don't worry. Arkham Knight is made by the creators of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City while Arkham Origins was made by another group called Warner Bros. Montreal. Rumor has it that Rocksteady was taking its time on Arkham Knight and as a result, Warner Bros decided to get another game created by another studio so we wouldn't have to wait too long after Arkham City to play another Batman game... resulting Arkham Origins. (Also, they could make a quick buck between the two releases.) As for Story, Characters, Gameplay, and Atmosphere, I held my expectations probably higher than I ever should have... and Arkham Knight exceeded them. It didn't exceed them just it's Batman and I'm a Batman fan, believe it or not, but because it's an incredibly well made game. Before moving too far along with this review, I'd like to point out that if you plan on gaming on the PC, (as you've heard) it's got quite a lot of problems. If you're thinking about using Steam's family sharing feature to play it or have a copy and you're waiting to play, I'd recommend waiting until the game is properly released on PC. However, on the contrary, if you're sensitive to spoilers, hurry up and play it as quickly as you can. This game is spoiler heavy and if I didn't bury myself in my office for 6 days, I would have spoiled it for myself the second I got on the internet and saw a single screen-shot. The point is, it's a story-driven game with plenty of twists and turns. In my personal opinion, it's the best in the series. Don't let anyone spoil it for you.<br /><br />Story:<br />Joker's dead, and for a while the crime in Gotham actually fell. However, that can only last so long... Scarecrow is back and working with a new villain who's calling himself the Arkham Knight. The experience leading into the Scarecrow story-line is exciting, suspenseful, and imaginative. He plays a great villain, however the majority of his work is behind the scenes. I was disappointed to find out that there aren't any true Scarecrow bits like there were from Arkham Asylum, and what truly disappointed me was I could point out a few times that they could have fit one in. However, although Scarecrow isn't used the same way as he was in Asylum, I must say he's used just as effectively in Knight. He fits right in, emerging himself in all of the other plots that contributed to the main story line. Arkham Knight, however didn't impress me as much. Luckily, the plot leading up to his mysterious identity is interesting enough, and kept me on my toes as much as the rest of the plot. Overall, the story of Batman: Arkham Knight, though it isn't the most inventive, is one of the most exciting, sometimes frightening, well executed, and dramatic stories in any video game I've played. Like I said in the opening paragraph, however, don't let anyone spoil it for you. In my opinion, it deserves the full 15/15.<br /><br />Visual Appeal:<br />The animation and graphics of the game were spot-on. They contributed well to the atmosphere of the game. Also, it doesn't hurt that the visual design of the game was gorgeous. I'm giving it a 9.5/10 because it's near perfect, but they weren't the best they could do. The animations for the main characters were wonderful, but the characters that aren't supposed to be given the attention needed more polishing. There were also small things that bothered me. For example, when you beat the last goon in a fight, he still makes the same whiny face and, like in all the other games, falls on his back, moving unsteadily until the game decides where it wants to put him. It's not a big deal, but I think now that we're four games in, we can come up with a rag doll effect or something so that it's more satisfying tosee Batman take some guys baseball bat and clobber him over the head with it. At least a few more animations would be nice. 9.5/10<br /><br />Characters:<br />What I love about the story/characters from Arkham Knight versus the other games is that it brings in only enough characters to support the plot. They all get a decent amount of screen-time and contribute to Batman's situation in some way. For example, I remember in Arkham City going to where Mr. Freeze was hiding so we could stop Penguin from doing... whatever it was that he was doing. Anyway, Mr. Freeze (And Penguin) contributed only to that mission. And that mission only contributed to giving Batman a new weapon. I was going about the rest of the story wondering how Penguin's little attack on Mr. Freeze would play out, but alas, it never did. At least not in the main story. I did miss Two-Face, Penguin, Catwoman, and Mr. Freeze, but most of them are available in side-missions. All in all, I feel that developing only the characters that serve the plot and developing them is the best way to do things and Arkham Knight chooses that path. It takes a handful of characters that we already loves and develops them into something more. 14/15<br /><br />Audio Appeal:<br />The music is wonderful and interacts well with what's on the screen and the sound effects are flawless. I will say, the epic thunderous sound effect that Batman's cape has when he starts to glide does get a little silly when he's only jumping from 10 feet, but nevertheless, it works well. 10/10<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />Everything wonderful from Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are here, and well improved upon. But.. I know what you guys want to read about: The Batmobile. Well, it all depends on who your are. If you're in the camp that hopes that the Batmobile won't be a requirement and you'll just be able to play the game without it, you'll probably be disappointed. There are quite the few missions that require you to utilize the Batmobile, however, after you unlock the full map and with those missions aside, you're pretty much able to do get to any place however you like. If you choose to drive the Batmobile for a quicker way to your next waypoint, you can. If you choose to enjoy the scenery and grapple-glide your way, you can. It all depends on preference. However, many will be disappointed to find how much easier it is to zoom through the city in the car versus taking your sweet time in the sky and like I said before, you only have that option after you've been to every area of the map. Luckily, the story is quick to put you in every area early on, so you don't have to wait long. As far as controls go, arguably they're spot on. I say arguably, because the physics is perfect and it legitimately feels like you're Batman driving through Gotham. The controls are causing a lot of controversy, though. There all alternatives, but I've found that the default controls have a 'Mirror's Edge' effect. They're perfect and nearly irreplaceable after you get used to them, but until then they're chaotic. The Batmobile also has a function called Battle Mode, which at first I thought was going to be gimmicky and silly, but in the end turned out to be a crucial part of what makes Arkham Knight's Batmobile fun. Pretty much, if you hold down the left trigger, you'll go into Battle Mode, wherein you get your full arsenal of weapons and have precise movement controls. In Battle Mode, you control the Batmobile's movement with the left analog stick, otherwise it works like a typical car in a driving game. Battle Mode is quite a bit slower than normal mode, though. So during speed chases or casually driving around Gotham, you'll won't spend too much time in Battle-Mode. However, because of the high speed nature of the Batmobile, the breaks are hilariously awful, (in a good way) so I typically will find myself entering Battle-Mode after bolting across the city like a /bat/ out of hell instead of screeching along the road and eventuallyramming into a building. It's just easier that way. However, the breaks will give you more of a Batman Begins tumbler feeling, so it's definitely fun either way. In areas non-Batmobile related, everything's pretty much the same. There are new take-down moves, and mechanics used when there is another colleague (i.e. Robin and Nightwing) join you in battle, you can switch using the left bumper (L1 on PS4) to switch between the two of you. You can also launch yourself off of rooftops after grappling to them like you could in Arkham Origins, so that makes transportation a bit faster. It's a non-crucial mechanic, but I was worried that it wouldn't carry over from Origins nonetheless. 15/15<br /><br />Mechanics/Performance:<br />Let me be frank, the PC version of this game made me rethink changing my rating system and promote the Mechanics/Performance category to a 15 point rating scale. Until now, I never really considered how much a bad port or terrible optimization for a specific platform can take away from the experience. The fact that Warner Bros let the game get release as it was is beyond me. The console version, I hear, is nearly flawless, though. So, if you have a PlayStation 4, definitely buy it for that. The game is playable on PC, (otherwise, I would have given it a 0/10 rating) however, it's extremely hardware specific and even on the best hardware comes with problems. All in all, I'm giving it a 9.5/10 for console and 1.5/10 for PC.<br /><br />Atmosphere:<br />When the series started with Batman: Arkham Asylum, the game was strong because of it's atmosphere. It really put you into Batman's shoes and made you /feel/ like you were the caped crusader, running around punching Joker's goons and solving Riddler's Riddles. You felt truly badass when you swooped down from a gargoyle or knocked an enemy out from behind. When you glided from the sky and shoved your foot into the goon's face, you could feel how terrifying it was to be them and seeing the Batman come from nowhere out of the night. The game was extremely atmospheric and made you feel like Batman. Arkham City, on the other hand opened the world up, allowing us to explore a unique area of Gotham like we've never been able to before. The story also gave us more villains, more side-missions and overall more things to do. Arkham Knight combines the best of these two like I never believed was possible. The world is multiple times the size of Arkham City, but is just as tight-knit as Arkham Asylum. Gotham is huge, open, but still dense and creative. The sound effects, music, and gorgeous graphics also contribute tremendously and as a result, everything just works. 15/15<br /><br />Congruency:<br />I'll admit, I'm a little tougher than I should be in this category. Congruency isn't something that should be worth 10 points on most standards, however it is something that bothers me in games. In Arkham Knight, everything is basically the way that it was in every other Arkham game, which isn't a bad thing. Goons all look the same and they all have the same voices, however there isn't anything that really sticks out or doesn't look like it shouldn't be there. 9/10<br /><br />Batman: Arkham Knight is the most ambitious, yet in my opinion the best addition to the Arkham Series. It's one of the few games I've played that, all in all, everything just works. It's well made, its characters are well utilized, it's story is well executed, and the game is perhaps one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. Not only is it a fitting and satisfying conclusion of the trilogy, but it's a full and wonderful game on its own. If you're looking for a thrilling, story-driven game, definitely check it out.

While the graphics are a bit dated the story and hours upon hours of game play make it well worth the money.

I played with my daughter when she was young, with my stepson later, and now I am going back to play them all over myself. I find this is a healthy diversion to the stresses of life, without being a first-person shooter. The games are clever, witty, and nobody is really hurt by insult sword fighting.<br /><br />I feel the game has only gotten better and better with each incarnation--the three games for PC in the 1990s, and now the Tales of Monkey Island in the 2000s. The jokes are as witty or wittier, the puzzles are just as puzzling or more, and the characters are great. The music is not quite as good. Threepwood's voice is still spot-on by the voice actor Dominic Armato!<br /><br />There is a kiss scene between Guybrush and Elaine in Chapter 2 that is really ... exciting! Also in chapter 2, the vacalians are charming merfolk from Atlantis. Their backstory is actually philosophically interesting, that they chose to go back into the sea rather than evolve on land with other humans. Very interesting!

6050,US,20916454,R2HNEPSDZCVU9D,B0088TPV54,N,Y,and liked it enough to buy DS2 and DS3 when they ...,"I've been a fan of the series from afar since the original announcement for the first game. Zombies terrify me, and the thought of playing against space zombies frayed my nerves, but I got the original Dead Space when Origin had it as an 'On the House' promotion, and liked it enough to buy DS2 and DS3 when they went on sale on Amazon.  DS3 is probably my favorite of the bunch. The story is fairly well done if you've been a series fan thus far, but not completely accessible if you're coming into it for the first time. I recommend checking out the DS wikis as you go to help fill in the gaps, minding spoilers. As for the action in this game, it was top notch, and some new cinematic story telling methods in this game set it apart from the others.  Also, I came out of DS2 with ungodly upgraded weapons, and coming into this game with its new crafting system threw me for a loop at first, but then quickly became the most enjoyable part of the game. (AFTER you get decent parts and figure out the system, of course. It takes a while, but it's worth it.) The crafting system allows you to manage your weapons in a style that fits you, instead of trying to figure out which weapon works 'best' or relying solely on which weapon you have ammo for. Ammo is universal this time around, so you're encouraged to make weapons that you like playing with. Seeing your new creations mow down necromorphs until you find another new part you want to try out propels you forward into the darkest corners of the game to see if you can find better upgrades. Even a coward like me kept pushing forward to see what else I could find, and enjoyably so.  So what kept it from getting 5 stars? Well, the first note would be about the co-op game play. I played solo, but this game DEFINITELY feels the bite of co-op design; every ambush you get caught in catches you from two directions. As a solo player, you understand very fast that this game was meant for two people as you constantly are being attacked from bothsides in lieu of having another player watching your six. For the solo campaign, you feel the sting as the challenge level increases A LOT from level design that had a volume of enemies made for two people with two sets of abilities and ammo. It's still workable as a solo player, but expect a hell of a lot of jump scares and some nasty deaths as you get quickly surrounded, flanked, or mauled. The cutscenes will feel more awkward too as the other player character 'appears' for a line of dialogue and then disappears like a phantom of your imagination.  And with the save system changed, some players may find that death gets frustrating; in some places, only your inventory is saved, so if you fought like hell through an optional area but died, you may find yourself going through it all over again but with less ammo, medpacks, and resources than you did the first time. Since you can't manually save, you have to be VERY judicious about when you start and stop, making sure that you have seen the auto save icon before shutting down.  Still, even with all that, I found myself immediately rolling up a new game + and steamrolling through necros with my now powered up guns from the first run and laughing giddily as bad guys fell before my onslaught. The game was tense, moody, atmospheric, and a heck of a lot of fun. I'm definitely going to play it again, and for a coward like me who's scared to death of space zombies, that's really saying something.",2015-07-06

6055,US,20916454,RIU0Q4JVG1FTG,B004JHYZKQ,N,Y,I thought the deal was too good to pass up,"Dead Space terrified me. So I was initially reluctant to purchase Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3, even when they went on sale here on Amazon for $5 apiece. Still, I thought the deal was too good to pass up, so I purchased both games.<br /><br />And then sat on them for a week. And then another week.<br /><br />When I finally got back from vacation and was ready to handle any necro induced nightmares at bedtime, I started this game up with a thudding in my chest and a nervous tingle throughout my body that made me want to bolt for the bathroom.<br /><br />By the end of the week, I had finished my first playthrough; I was glad to have finished the ride, and seriously looking forward to DS3!<br /><br />So what can you expect? Well, if you're a first time player, DS2 plays a lot like the original, with a few tweaks, There's a few new weapons, (hello, Javelin Gun!) but you're still limited to carrying 4 at a time with limited space for ammo, health, and resources. For new players, this is survival horror, and you can expect to be scrambling during the game to conserve your ammunition, move slowly through areas, and explore heavily. Action set pieces are way more predominant, and Issac Clarke is now a voiced character instead of a silent everyman. For me, this made the game MUCH less scary and way more entertaining, since I found myself rooting for Issac way more than I did in the first game. The interactions with other characters felt more real, and Issac's personal plight had more substance. The new setting, &#34;The Sprawl&#34; was gorgeous at times to look at, which really juxtaposed the deadly danger that was constantly surrounding me as a player.<br /><br />Gameplay wise, you're still cutting the limbs off necromorphs, so this is NOT a game for the faint of heart. Old necro types return along with some new types, and all of them are deadly efficient. There's some great jump scares, but mainly, the antagonists feel strangely fair; they're extraordinarily consistent. They stick to their attack patterns, allowing you to learn them and find a counter-strategy. The game will do a great job of mixing in various types of necros and forcing you to deal with them on the fly, but I never encountered anything that felt like a cheap death, or like the game cheated somehow. Once you know what you are facing and how to deal with it, your solution is set. The game will still throw many curveballs at you as far as where the encounters happen and what you'll be facing when you get in there, but if your aim is true and your heart stout, you can make it. (Maybe not on the first try, but eventually.)<br /><br />Overall, I finished this game hungry for more and way less unnerved than I was in the first game... possibly because, like Isaac, we had now survived for the second time. And what rush it was!",2015-07-06

It's difficult to explain why I like this game so much which couldn't be further from those I just mentioned. But I do. This game is great.<br /><br />The main character is Aurora, the daughter of a king. She falls ill and is believed to be on the verge of death when she emerges in a dream world. From there, the adventure begins. Here are the things that make this game charming:<br /><br />1. The dialogue is very poetic. It flows nicely. It helps give it a dreamy feel. Oddly enough, it actually feels peaceful to play this game.<br /><br />2. The gameplay itself is very simple. No complex button combos. The battle system is turn based with some unique twists but nothing overly involved. Sometimes, it's just nice to play a simpler game rather than a game that has overly complex play.<br /><br />3. Advancement is relatively quick. It's great to play a game where level advancement doesn't take forever. It isn't like you level up after every battle, but it is quick enough that you can see some progress and feel like you're accomplishing something.<br /><br />Again, I'm typically a lover of violent, destroy-everything games and this game is about as different from that as you get. Needless to say, it is an addictive game and has a unique charm to it.",2015-07-06

Also, the only reason I didn't give it a full five stars was the ending; after all you go through to get there, the ending felt very unspectacular.

6123,US,45756520,R28ZZEJLA3AAZN,B00T6T9B5G,N,Y,You can skip this one,"Extremely average Assassin's Creed game. If you've played any of the others, you've played this one too.<br />It's a very by-the-numbers Ubisoft game. Several hours of story missions, that if asked later you'd probably only recall a few key points and hardly any plot, and tons of collectibles all marked on your map waiting to be picked up. Rogue has a fairly expansive map to roam however at least half, if not more, of it consists of areas filled solely with unnecessary collectibles (which might I add, don't even unlock anything worthwhile). You will never visit these areas unless you go out of your way to gather collectibles, and these are not just small areas like the isolated island in Black Flag, no these are actual towns/villages and lots of them.<br /><br />The ship was a popular aspect of Black Flag, and with good reason, it was different and very fun. The ship here doesn't get used much and when it does it's just not the same. Enemies don't put up a fight, your ship quickly overpowers everything else, the missions are lackluster and everything feels like you've done it before. It's like the Jackdaw but with a couple &#34;upgrades&#34; for example the swivel gun in BF was single-shot and used after hitting an enemy to deal extra damage. The swivel gun in Rogue can be used any time and is fully automatic, meaning wiping out an entire ships crew is laughably easy and even the crews of the toughest ships can be eliminated between the time you initiate the boarding sequence and when you actually reach the enemy.<br /><br />The whole game feels like it could be played on auto-pilot. That's not to say it's a bad game. It's not. It's just nothing great. If you're looking for a great game you can play over and over, and can thoroughly enjoy while 100%'ing this is not the game for you, it's very repetitive and will tire you quickly. If you're new to the series, don't start here. There's much better options in the AC franchise.<br />If you're a fan of the series, have played the rest and are looking to pick this up, do so when you find a good deal. I paid $15 and feel I got my moneys worth out of it, though I left a lot of side content undone as so much of it was pointless, boring, and out-of-the-way.layed the rest and are looking to pick this up, do so when you find a good deal.

6257,US,43902240,R2GLRKQ2DR8GNM,B00PZ0DT4E,N,N,I Should have never asked for a refund!...,"First off let me just say that this is the first Simcity game I ever played. With that being said, I didn't know what to expect. I heard from other reviews about the game being slow and choppy. I'm using a 2.6 intel core i5 running 8gb of RAM and was a little scared because of all the negative reviews. At first never playing the game and getting used to the controls I thought that all the reviews were right, but when you try to use a mouse, the sensitivity is a little too unbearable. So I applied for a refund. An hour later after applying for my refund, I decided to try it again. This time I tried to learn and play with the keyboard and mouse. I'm not as fast as people I see on Youtube, but it's so much of a difference to the game play. I got got hooked and played the game for 9 hours on and off before my account was cut off due to my refund being approved. My decision now is that I want to get the game back because I haven't had so much fun with a computer game since Knights of the Old Republic. Definitely for me, It's a 5 star if you take the time to make it work for you. I'm definitely going to purchase this game again and look forward to making a more efficient city",2015-07-04

I have played and liked all the Virtual Villager games before this. They're good for the downtime at my job when they're nothing going on. But the whole point of video games is to be entertained and I don't think going to someone else's island and forcing my religion onto them would ever been entertaining. I know it's a video game, not a documentary. So it's not exaclty realistic or based on true events or anything. But still it amazes me that the whole point of this chapter of the series is to force your beliefs on the locals. I thought the whole point of Virtual Villagers originaly was to survive from scratch on some foreign island or in the wilderness. It takes a lot to offend me and most games don't.

This game was nice and the puzzles blended decently so you didn't feel like you were just doing puzzles to get somewhere. I do agree that there were a lot of puzzles - and they're logic puzzles so I used a walkthrough and the hint system for most of the puzzles, but still they were kinda realistic for keeping things safe. As I did the puzzles and went through the game, I still kept in mind the story and the task at hand and why Nancy was there, and the puzzles didn't distract that thought either. The only thing I didn't like was that when you're making food, it's another puzzle- I preferred actually making food like in the past games. This food puzzle reminded me of the food game in the game where Nancy goes to Japan, but luckily you don't have to do the food puzzle, so it worked out. But I gave the rating a 4 instead of 5 because there was a lot of puzzles, I like the older games where there was a few puzzles. It's still a good game though, I've already played it twice.",2015-07-03

6460,US,17119551,RL0DVRSBPP906,B00BM7JK6K,N,N,"Not like the older ridge racer games, but that's not such a bad thing.","I just picked this up on sale and I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the reviews that said this game was bad and gave it a low score. I am having an absolute blast playing it ! It's a lot of fun and quite challenging if you try to get all the stars for each track. There are over 60 races to complete and you can create your own tracks as well. The Multi-player is shut down so don't buy it for online play.  I have played many Ridge Racer games in the past and I loved R4 back in the day. Some may complain that this doesn't feel like a Ridge Racer game and they would be somewhat right. It's Ridge Racer to the extreme. The Ridge Racer game series needed to evolve with new gameplay and this game does that. It still has the Ridge Racer &#34;vibe&#34; with all the power-sliding/drifting you can handle while listening to techno style music. But, it adds in destructible environments with alternate routes you open up by smashing through walls and buildings on each course. It also has opponent take downs like we have seen in games like burnout.  All of this destruction adds to your power/turbo meter. You can keep the meter filled up by causing destruction to the other racers and the environment. Keeping your meter maxed as often as possible is essential to winning races because the AI is not easy to beat. They drive well, boost often and will even &#34;frag&#34; you when you are ahead of them. Even if you don't come in first you still get points so losing the race is not always a bad thing.  In additon to the main &#34;domination&#34; mode there are several other game modes to mix things up. There is a mode called &#34;Shindo&#34; that is a lot like recent RR games where you just get boost for power-sliding and the environment is less destructible. There's also drift attack, time attack and a &#34;frag&#34; mode where you try to destroy as many opponents as possible. All are fun in there own way and you can apply these modes to the tracks you create as well.  My biggest complaint with Ridge Racer unbounded is that there needs to be more options to change the graphics and control settings for the game. They are extremly limited and it's obvious this is a console port. The game still looks good but more settings for the PC version would have been appreciated. Also, some races are very difficult and require multiple attempts. You will need to chain boosts together to win. So it can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Makes winning that much more rewarding though. Other than that it's a solid arcade racer.  Overall, the game is just plain fun and that's what counts to me. I don't understand why people don't like it. Maybe they are struggling to win the races. As I mentioned, some races are very difficult and will require multiple attempts to win. As with other racing games it takes some practice to get use to the handling of the cars. Also, there is a button for drifting and you should use it instead of the brakes to start your drift.  Maybe the people who don't like it expect it to be like the older Ridge Racer games but I'm actually glad it's different than the previous games. Why make a new Ridge Racer game if it's doesn't add anything different ? Also, I don't care that the MP is dead. I don't play MP on many games anyway. So if your looking for a fun, challenging, over the top, arcade racing experience give this game a try.  8 out of 10",2015-07-02

6474,US,30453009,R1SHDIQ3NADXEB,B00YFP4ZLQ,N,Y,Save your $40 dollars until at Least Late August/Early September.,"Updated as of July 16th, 2015<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! Unintentional Spoilers maybe present in the review. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br /><br />The rating I am currently giving the Batman Arkham Knight Season Pass is tentative and will most likely change once the Season Pass DLC is all released. As of this writing the only thing that is currently available thru this season pass is the Batman flashpoint skin, which by itself is not worth the $40 dollars at this time. According to Rocksteady all the Pre-order Exclusive DLC that is currently available if you pre-ordered the Arkham Knight WILL NOT be available to the Season Pass until sometime in Late August/Early September 2015 which is the following DLC...<br />- The Harley Quinn Story Pack (2.5 out of 5 stars)<br />  The DLC can be accessed through the &#34;Arkham Episodes&#34; option on your Main Menu of the game once installed.<br />  Synopsis: This takes place just before the events of the Main Arkham Knight Story Line &#34;The City Of Fear&#34; where you play as Harley Quinn on orders from Scarecrow and Penguin to break out Poison Ivy of The Bludheaven Police lockup so you can bring her to the big meeting that Scarecrow will be having with the other villains of Batman's Rouge Gallery.<br />  The Pros: You get to play as Harley Quinn and use unique gadgets, specialized Baseball Bat, and her unique fighting style. Great Graphics, Control movements, and the best part her &#34;Psychotic Vision&#34; (Instead of Detective Vision) were when in use you get to hear all of Harley's self doubts become vocal.<br /> The Cons: WAAAYYYY to short, you can literally beat this in less that a half hour. Just as you are really getting into it the DLC ends.<br /> Overall: Had alot of potential that never came to light, this was a big disappointment to me and feel Rocksteady screwed over the fans on. As my son puts it &#34;It's the equivalent of a extended Predator Challenge Map&#34;. Fortunately I got this for free with my game so I did not put any money out on.<br />- The Red Hood Story Pack<br />  The DLC can be accessed through the &#34;Arkham Episodes&#34; of the Main Menu Menu of the game once installed.<br />- The Scarecrow Nightmare Missions (PlayStation 4 Exclusive, Now available at the PlayStation store as well)<br />  The DLC can be accessed through the &#34;AR Challenges&#34; of your Main Menu of the game once installed.<br />- The First Appearance of Batman Skin (Detective Comic #27, 1939) *<br />- The New 52 Exclusive Skins (If you have a PlayStation 4 this is a free download via the PlayStation Store as of this writing) *<br />- The 60's TV Batman (Adam West) , Justice League 3000, and The 60's TV Show Batmobile skin Pack *<br /><br />On top of the ones that I just mentioned Rocksteady will also be releasing the following DLC either around the same time frame as the pre-order DLC or later in 2015....<br />- Batgirl: A Matter of Family (4.25  out of 5 stars, Released to Season Pass Holders starting July 14th, 2015 and to everyone else July 21st, 2015)<br />  The DLC can be accessed through the &#34;Arkham Episodes&#34; option on your Main Menu of the game once installed.<br />  Synopsis: In this DLC you get to play as Barbara Gordon as Batgirl at the peak of her physical abilities before the events of the &#34;Killing Joke&#34; which then confines her into a wheelchair. The Story starts you out as Batgirl meeting up with Robin (Tim Drake) at a Oil Rig station that has been converted/turned into an amusement park to rescue Commissioner Gordon (Barbara's Father) from the Joker who is using him and other members of the GCPD as bait to lure the Batman's protege's into what Joker hopes to be there doom. In the Batman Arkham Universe I would say this story probably takes place about 2 or 3 years before Arkham Asylum.<br />  The Pros: You get to play for the first time as a fully functional Batgirl that exhibits both her physical fighting style and intellectual skills (Not like in &#34;Injustice&#34; where you just get to use her fighting skills). Great Story campaign with alot of the same game play from the main Arkham Knight game but with some slight variations. Has an interesting side mission reminiscent of the Arkham Asylum History concerning the history behind the amusement park. Great performance as usual by Mark Hamill as the Joker.<br /> The Cons: Harley really just has an extended Cameo, Rocksteady has really wasted this character's potential now in 2 DLC's, would have like to seen more of her. Some of the game play felt a little reminiscent of the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC from Arkham City (Popping Balloon's through out the park). I understand this is a DLC but would have liked to see maybe a gadget upgrade or two other than just the standard stock.<br /> Overall: A Vast improvement over the Harley Quinn Story Pack (and from what I hear I am sure the Red Hood one as well) with at least 4 to 5 hours of gameplay (Including the little side stuff) and when the main campaign ends to continue play the side stuff you may have not had time to take care of during the main campaign, for those who like collecting their trophies like I do.<br />- The Season of Infamy<br />- Episodes from Gotham City (Additional Story Packs DLC's)<br />- Additional Skins. *<br /><br />* All skins can be accessed through the &#34;Showcase&#34; option of your Main Menu of the game once installed.<br /><br />Now $40 dollars under normal circumstances for a Season Pass I would consider outrages but if Rocksteady comes through on their content they are promising to deliver than the $40 would be a pittance com paired to the $15 to $20 per Story Pack DLC for each.<br /><br />I'll keep updating this post when more information comes available.m the main Arkham Knight game but with some slight variations.

6483,US,17119551,R1LHWR9SG6I6BU,B00O4CRN6Y,N,N,Fantastic Stealth Gameplay,"I have always enjoyed steath games and I am really enjoying Styx. I agree with the other positive reviews that if you like stealth games then get Styx Master of Shadows. Don't expect to be going around fighting all the time, thats not what the game is about. You are a 3 foot tall goblin with a dagger not a big badass warrior. It's a stealth game not an action game. That doesn't mean Styx isn't deadly. He is skilled at killing enemy after enemy from the shadows. Sneaking up on your enemies for a kill or avoiding them all together is the best way to play the game.<br /><br />Styx is a great character with a lot of personality. It's fun being Styx. The stealth works well and the abilities you earn add to the choices you have when making your way to the next objective.. The problems people had with ledge detection and climbing when the game was released have been patched so that is not a problem any more.<br /><br />I think the graphics are good, not the best ever but they get the job done for sure. The environments and characters are detailed, the lighting is pretty good. I lowered the brightness to make the dark feel dark. The world you traverse is big and there are lots of different paths to discover as you explore the environment. The background music fits the mood and the voice over is good.<br /><br />If I had to fault the game at all I would say they should add an animation of Styx crawling over the edge of ledges and make it so you can move to the next section of the ledge at a corner. Also, they could improve some of the character animations for Styx and the NPC's to look and feel more natural.<br /><br />Overall Styx is one of my new favorite games. It reminds me of tenchu stealth assassin's on the PS1. No guns or fancy gadgets. Just you, your blade and your stealth skills. I'm so glad I bought Styx and I really hope they make Styx 2.",2015-07-02

I just recently bought it because I forgot what happened through the game and I wanted to refresh my memory. I think the story line is amazing and for being an older game, the graphics are very interesting.  Pros: there are characters from all ages so you can get a glimpse of everything. I love how it is based off of a myth. I know some people don't find this as a plus but at the beginning when it stated what you are doing and why it is a mystery, you probably had no explanation for what was going on. At least I didn't. I loved how Jane made you play the games with her and they weren't tedious except a few. The games were actually fun to play. The parrot was a nice touch to an already fun and interesting game and soo many more that are too long to explain : Cons: Some of the puzzles were difficult to understand and you needed many hits and walkthroughs the ending was not what I expected at all  Overall the game was amazing and I loved it",2015-07-01

Bought one of these because I couldn't get onscreen and online renewals at Xbox.com to take either my credit card or debit card.  Gave me digital code just fine, but Xbox indicates that this payment method is not valid when I try to redeem the prepaid code, either onscreen or online.  The error code isn't helpful.  However, an online Google search suggests that the issue is that I previously opted out of auto-renewal and that I must wait until the account expires in 2 days and try again.  Don't know if this will be true or not, and don't know if it will mean losing the account or not by waiting.  If it turns out that Microsoft is punishing me (and others) for not giving them authorization to automatically charge my credit card, I will start screaming about this to as many consumer agencies as I can find.  In the meantime, be careful buying this prepaid code -- if you can't get the Xbox renewal to work directly, this one may not work either (though they will certainly take your money for this). Follow-up - account expired, redeemed code, account renewed.  Still getting renewal messages on consoles.  Trying not to accidentally get billed on credit card for another renewal.  Overall, another example of Microsoft intentionally making it difficult on consumers if you don't comply with their desires (automatic renewal)",2015-07-01

The two of them work together in interesting ways. For instance, you might start one puzzle in space ship mode, only to have to dock and go into side-scrolling mode in order to complete the puzzle.<br /><br />The game does a fairly good job of bringing you up to speed with the controls: first, you start with basic shooting and teleporting, and then puzzles(gates), bombs, and then bookmarks are introduced. The bookmarks enable the developer to construct complex levels where you'll have to backtrack in order to achieve higher scores and explore the entire level. The side-scrolling mode has its own puzzles, as well as tools, so you get introduced to them as well.<br /><br />The game's well done, in that the difficulty level isn't set high, and it only gets hard if you want to say, pick up every crystal, or finish the level in the fastest possible time in order to achieve a gold medal or what-not. I'm largely immune to this types of in-game lures, but if you're not, then you're probably going to replay levels over and over again in order to hit those achievements.<br /><br />Where the game falls down, however, is that it level-locks later levels to a total achievement score! That effectively forces you to go and replay levels until you get enough points to let you keep going in the game. If this was a mobile game, I'd expect there to be a micro-transaction engine reminding you over and over again that you can buy your way past those artificial barriers. Unfortunately, this is a full-priced game with a retail price (on amazon for $19.99) for the PC version. (I'm sure you can find it for $5 on a steam sale) That makes me scratch my head. Why would you punish your purchasers by locking out content in order to grind the same levels over and over again if you've already got their money?!!! Clearly the game designers think that the only people who might buy such a game are those who have an infinite amount of time to replay content they've already played once.<br /><br />Because of this stupid decision, I can't recommend the game at full price. If you can get it for under $5 on a steam sale it's worth a shot if you think you'll like the combination of elements, but otherwise, it's a take-it-or-leave it game. That's a pity, because without the cap, I'd probably play the game to completion. As it is, I'm stuck in one of the later levels with no desire to replay all the previous levels.",2015-07-01

They are a big part of the problem of how AAA video game publishers deal with their products, demanding ridiculous prices for additional content. Unless you can buy a game with it's season pass included for a good price, they are usually not worth it. I was not happy with my season pass purchase for Injustice: Gods Among Us back when it was released. It felt like I wasted money because I was not overly satisfied of the roster that I paid for. However, that's not the case for MKX's Kombat Pack!<br /><br />It's as if NetherRealm actually read and amended to the negative feedback they received from Injustice's season pass. Yes, the on Disc Goro unlock is still there and and not included which is a shame. But what about the new fighters? As planned, each new character comes with their own 3 set fighting variations, 2 fatalities, 4 (or 5?) brutalities, voice (though none for Jason, haha) and varying intros. Included with each release are also 3 skins for different characters that actually look like NetherRealm put effort into. So far, Jason Vorhees from the Friday the 13th franchise and Tanya from MK4 have been released. Both are worth playing and feel like they belong in a MK game. The extra skins you get, like the Horror pack, are fun to play with.<br /><br />If you are like me, then you are probably excited about the fast approaching Predator DLC. I won't go into detail about what we're getting, but you can tell that NetherRealm had fun with this one. Even if you did not buy the Season Pass, fans of the first Predator film: THIS IS THE DLC TO BUY. I believe that each new character with skins are $5 by themselves so idealy you get one free character for buying this. With the extra stuff that comes with each, so far this Season pass has been worth it. The Predator pretty much had me when he was announced...then you find out what comes with him. It's like Christmas in the 80s all over again.",2015-07-01

6697,US,13707894,R2KIF6SUPYQ07P,B00LLIQWKC,N,Y,The House of Wolves is a Worthy Expansion Pack,"The House of Wolves expansion Pack fixes many of the issues and unpopular features introduced by the Dark Below expansion Pack.<br />Although the Dark below introduced my favorite Raid, Crota, many of the tweaks to the game's economy made activities a grind. The Vanguard and Crucible commendations and the full reset of upgraded exotic wweapons are included on this list of bad features. Thankfully, a lot of the grindy elements of the game have been tweaked or removed.<br /><br />You still have to put a lot of time into this game for the rewards, but it's more varied than before. The recently added activities like the Prison of Elders arena horde mode, the VIP Wolf Targets and the Targets that prowl the world in set locations vary the game play so my weekly checklist of things to do in the game is less like a job and generally varied enough to keep things fresh when I log onto the game.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Vanguard and Crucible commendations are gone.<br />2. The speaker can convert radiant shards and energy.<br />3. Higher powered weapons that peak at 365.<br />4. Maximum light level increased to 34, which makes the Crota Raid easier, but still fun.<br />5. More events occur in the open world, making it more fun to just roam around and engage enemies.<br />6. With the change in the economy, buying materials like helium filaments from the crucible quartermaster is a more viable strategy.<br />7. The wolf story missions are pretty fun even if the maps they occur on are not all brand new.<br />8. Prison of Elders can be a blast to play with the right 3 people.<br />9. Upgrading your exotics with ethereal light does not reset all of its activated perks<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. This is still Destiny, so if you didn't like playing the game before, this expansion pack will not change your mind.<br />2. This game needs dedication to unlock all of it's rewards. For some, like myself, this is a plus.<br /><br />Buy this expansion pack if you are a fan of Destiny.",2015-06-30

I've played MMOs since WoW was released, and gave up WoW a few years ago because the immature player population got old.  ESO attracts a more mature population and you will not encounter as many rude and obnoxious players.  ESO has one of the best PvP games I've encountered to date, even better than GW2.  This is my favorite game for more than a year now.  To those who say its not like Elder Scrolls, I don't agree.

6705,US,11352677,R3NGQUDBTER4PJ,B00U6IN5QM,N,N,Disappointing attempt at a completely different game from the real Battlefield.,"Bought the game on Origin. Here's the deal, I understand the developers were looking for something new, but the cops vs. criminals campaign is nothing at all like previous battlefields. That alone is enough to make me skeptical about the game, but on top of that it was just executed very poorly. The campaign missions are slow and unexciting, and half the time you're expected to scan the area through a pair of goggles to look for &#34;clues&#34;, which most of the time take 30 minutes to find. I was expecting am exciting military combat game, but instead got a disappointing attempt at a completely different game from what I knew before. It wouldn't be that bad if the multiplayer was good, but unfortunately that too is horrible. Gun options are totally limited, and the game modes are just set up in a way that you inevitably will die over and over and over again so quickly and frequently to the point where it gets pointless to play. Most classic game modes are gone and replaced with bad attempts at new ones that seem like they weren't thought out too well. The spawns are absolutely horrid, expect to be spawn killed A LOT in this game. On top of all that, the game is so bad there's literally only about 5 North American servers with a decent amount of players on them. Don't buy. Save your hard earned money and don't throw it away on this trash.",2015-06-29

Every player in the game is forced to use their gamertag/psnID as their character name, so if you like playing with players named (actual examples) Menstrual_Salsa or CUNNNNNNNNNT, this game will be right up your alley. If you were to make a drinking game out of how many people are named OG_kush_bluntz_420 you would die of alcohol poisoning within 15 minutes.<br /><br />2. There is no text chat. You are forced to use voice chat, which means every time you zone into a major city, you have people screaming into their microphone, blasting music, or telling you how much they love people of different races. You also get to listen to horrible microphone feedback, dogs barking, people snoring at their microphone and other delightful sounds. You are automatically put into area chat and there is no way to permanently disable it. (You can turn player voices all the way off in the settings.) Not having text chat makes this the loneliest MMORPG in existence. It's impossible to have a voice chat conversation with 30 people piled into the channel being idiots.<br /><br />3. No real way to customize the UI, putting the experience bar on your screen, etc.<br /><br />4. Overall, the gameplay is fun for what it is, but the community and the tools with which to interact with the community suck. Trading is archaic and difficult to do due to voice chat.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't gotten the digital version of this game so that I could sell it to OG_Quikscope_420blazeitjunior.<br /><br />If they finally implement text chat, I'll be back, until then, have fun!",2015-06-29

If you need to access the internet you'll do it from Windows 8 or Windows 7 which your PC is probably running) and you'll get  those annoying &#34; Hey, get a legitimate copy of windows xp&#34;  error messages.. which is kind of hard to do since  Microsoft officially no longer supports Windows XP meaning they don't offer it for sale.. in short Microsoft probably couldn't care in the slightest if you're using Windows  XP to run an older game that is just plain too old for Win 8 or Win 7 ....<br /><br />Note in virtualbox you'll probably have to go to &#34;settings&#34;, then &#34;network&#34;, notice that &#34;NAT is already selected there should be a dropdown box next to it  .... you may have to click on the various options there if you're really intent on getting internet access while you're in Win XP mode... quite frankly there's no need for internet access whatsoever far as I'm concerned , you're in Win XP mode purely to run Creatures Exodus.. just minimize virtualbox and access the internet from your Windows 7  or Windows 8 &#34;normal&#34; PC setup if you have a question you need to google about what's going on in Creatures Exodus at the time then go back to your Win XP/Creatures Exodus game.<br /><br />(note however that if you're lucky and have the &#34;right&#34; version of Windows 7 which most people don't have but who knows maybe you do?  The Professional version of Win 7 for example... it has Win XP functionality built right into it... see<br /><br />http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7<br /><br />Unfortunately no such support built into Windows 8 )<br /><br />If  you're running an older  PC  with Win XP  then you're in luck !  This game should work on your PC without any problems to begin with... except for the online requirement for Docking Station for which there is a workaround (see below)<br /><br />Docking Station when it's installed assumes that the server for it is still online.. given the game came out in 1999 it's probably no surprise that server is no longer active .. always say &#34;no&#34; to the &#34;do you want to update to the latest version&#34; update that Docking Station prompts you for every time you run Docking Station or it will  render docking station unusable and you'll have to install it again.. do however go to this website<br /><br />http://www.creaturesdockingstation.com/<br /><br />scroll down to &#34; playing DS offline&#34;, click on the  link where it says &#34;simple login patch&#34; and follow the instructions mentioned in the &#34;read me&#34; notepad text that is part of the download (it doesn't mention this but you want to go into &#34;my PC&#34;, &#34;C&#34;, &#34;program files 86&#34;, &#34;gameware development&#34; and then you'll see the folders they're talking about)... follow the instructions and make sure to click on the middle button that appears in between the green checkmark and the red circle button when you're creating your new world using docking station and you should be good to go.<br /><br />If anyone has any further questions leave a comment, I'll answer it and help you out as best I can .... also worth noting there are rumors of &#34;Creatures 4&#34; being released in November 2015 at the time I'm writing this review which I'm assuming will run much more smoothly on the modern day Windows 7 / Windows 8 PC's ;)  ...",2015-06-29

You hook up to fire hydrants and use hoses to put out fires and rescue people etc.  So far kind of cool.  But here is where it gets bad.  The calls repeat over and over.  The exact same calls with no variation.  Once you figure out how to pass something the game just becomes work.  Once you get enough money or calls or whatever you get a new call that if you pass you get something new like a fire station or a vehicle.  Once you get high enough that you get a foam tender and a water tender (whatever those are in the US), you don't really even need the other stuff at other calls.  You just drive them to the fire, spray them, and you are done.  Also, some vehicles don't even need to be used.  Still not sure what a powder tender is but you don't ever use it.

I ended up getting enough light to get to level 23 but then quit. I probably should have just steered clear of the DLC's for it but I really really wanted Destiny to be the game that was talked about before it came out so I took a chance and got the DLC. The new end game content for the House of Wolves requires you to finish the new 'story' missions, which in all fairness have much more story to them than the base game did. This was so frustrating because the missions get slightly higher levels but your level depends on random loot drops. I got to level 26 but could not get any more gear with higher light so I am sure the level 28 story missions are doable at 26, I was not able to. I know I could go grind strikes to get the rep and marks for gear but the 5 or so strikes get old pretty quick.

Most notably is the graphics difference between PC & Xbox 360. Depending on the hardware your desktop/laptop has, you will have to run your graphic settings accordingly. Connection to GTAO (GTA Online) is smooth, very rarely will there be any connectivity issues. However, since PC release, there has been an increase in online modders/hackers. So GTAO experience can vary depending on which lobby you are thrown into. The only downside to PC Download is the size of the file. If your download speed is fast, then it shouldn't take too long.

I would recommend picking it up on sale.<br /><br />I remember playing this game when I was about 10 and having a blast. Though at the time I'm sure many of the concepts went over my head and I remember being more interested in stealing everything in every house and amassing a gigantic fortune than in the great quests. I won't gloss over much of the game as there are already many other reviews that do so. If you are the type that jumps in and expects the game to be great immediately, well it isn't. But spend a few hours, do some of the hilarious and great side quest and there will be an appreciation as you run about with that great sound track playing in the background. Over 10 years old now and still has the best soundtrack of any Elder scroll's game to date.

6882,US,13052828,R3DO1CCXWVGX1W,B00NWY0DYE,N,Y,"As an FF fan, this game is fun.","I may be biased because I love the Final Fantasy series.  I've played this game both on PS3 and Steam. It was easy to download the Steam program and get the game up and running with the online code.  No problems at all.  The game may take a bit to download though because of it's size and depending on how fast your computer and connection is.  It wasn't terrible too playing with the default keyboard settings, the camera may take a bit getting used to, especially if you're used to the controller, but you can set it up to use a controller.<br /><br />As far as the game goes, the other reviews are pretty on par.  I would say if you're a FF fan, it's worth giving it a shot.  It is pretty linear until a certain point, but I feel even then the exploration is limited and it doesn't seem like there's a whole heck of a lot of side quests compared to the past games.  You do A LOT of fighting in this game, main quest and side quest wise.  And the leveling system is reminiscent of FFX's sphere grid, except I feel you had more freedom in FFX.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I do love the story, the graphics, THE MUSIC, and the characters.  If you like exploring all over the place, like FF12, this game probably isn't for you.  If you hate fighting all the time, this game very most likely isn't for you.  If you like battle systems where you have time to think and want to be choosey about how you fight, well.... I feel like button mashers would feel more comfortable with this game.<br /><br />If you're looking for a game that's pretty, has good music, awesome characters and a decent story line, this could be your game.  As well as relatively quick game to get through....  I would say an avg 4-5 hours a day gaming you can get it done in about 2 weeks the main quests and doing some leveling up and some side quests. You could definitely stretch it with the side quests, and you can plow right through it pretty quick, but some of the boss battles are going to be a pain.",2015-06-28

This is challenging but some objects are easy to find so you don't get totally frustrated.  I've seen other reviewers complain about having to &#34;buy&#34; hints and other tools. Well you &#34;buy&#34; them with points you earn from completing puzzles--no real money required beyond the purchase price of the game. There are TON of objects  There are 8 themes, each theme has 9 different scenes with about 40 hidden objects which makes a total of 72 scenes in this game.  Each time you play it will ask you to find about 20 of the objects, never the same twenty that you had the time before, and they are in a different order, so it's not boring. Besides the hints I just mentioned, there are tools that stop or slow the clock for a minute, a magic wand that zaps an item for each one you find, one that removes the point penalty for wrong clicks, and finally one that lights up the entire scene on those that are blacked out except for a small circle you move around.  There are a couple of quirks. I don't know where this game was developed, but I don't think it was in the USA or by someone who was a native English speaker. Many items are named wrong (telescopes are called microscopes) or are identified with names not common in the U.S.  Metal boxes (like Altoids come in) are called Tin Cans, fishing lures are called fish bait, a medicine bottle is a phial, a visor is a sun cap, handkerchiefs are tissues, colored pencils are crayons and boom boxes are called cassette recorders!  I have yet to figure out what &#34;cleaves&#34; are!  It can be challenging until you figure these out.  My only real complaint is that I can't figure out how to zoom in (laptop with touchpad running Windows 8.1). If anyone knows how to zoom, please reply. I've tried all sorts of maneuvers on the touchpad, but all I get are unwanted clicks. I have this on my iPad and it is easy to zoom by stretching the touchscreen.

This is challenging but some objects are easy to find so you don't get totally frustrated. I've seen other reviewers complain about having to &#34;buy&#34; hints and other tools. Well you &#34;buy&#34; them with points you earn from completing puzzles--no real money required beyond the purchase price of the game. There are TON of objects There are 8 themes, each theme has 9 different scenes with about 40 hidden objects which makes a total of 72 scenes in this game. Each time you play it will ask you to find about 20 of the objects, never the same twenty that you had the time before, and they are in a different order, so it's not boring. Besides the hints I just mentioned, there are tools that stop or slow the clock for a minute, a magic wand that zaps an item for each one you find, one that removes the point penalty for wrong clicks, and finally one that lights up the entire scene on those that are blacked out except for a small circle you move around. There are a couple of quirks. I don't know where this game was developed, but I don't think it was in the USA or by someone who was a native English speaker. Many items are named wrong (telescopes are called microscopes) or are identified with names not common in the U.S. Metal boxes (like Altoids come in) are called Tin Cans, fishing lures are called fish bait, a medicine bottle is a phial, a visor is a sun cap, handkerchiefs are tissues, colored pencils are crayons and boom boxes are called cassette recorders! I have yet to figure out what &#34;cleaves&#34; are! It can be challenging until you figure these out. My only real complaint is that I can't figure out how to zoom in (laptop with touchpad running Windows 8.1). If anyone knows how to zoom, please reply. I've tried all sorts of maneuvers on the touchpad, but all I get are unwanted clicks. I have this on my iPad and it is easy to zoom by stretching the touchscreen. I think half the fun is seeing all the hundreds of ingeniously hidden objects, many that are never in the list you need toretching the touchscreen.

It's a mix between the story and gameplay of Gearbox's classic shooter with a few recurring motifs from the Telltale Games style of storytelling.  In this review we're covering episode 3, but this video should apply both to people who are new to the Tales From The Borderlands series as well those who have only played the first episode or two.  I'll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum, but it's essential to talk about the narrative in this story driven game.  Let's take a look at Tales From The Borderlands and see if it's worth playing.<br /><br />Tales takes place in the Borderlands universe, but unlike the Borderlands games you aren't playing as a Vault Hunter.  You play as Rhys, a Hyperion employee who is trying to work his way to the top of the corporate ladder.  You also control Fiona who is a con artist working on Pandora.  The two characters come together and through unlikely odds become allies.  The story takes place after Borderlands 2 in the wake of  Handsome Jack's demise.  Yet he still has a presence in this game.  Ironically, these non-Vault Hunters turn their primary focuses to finding a Vault.<br /><br />Episode 3 is the middle of this five part series and it definitely shows.  Character development starts to flush out more as everyone tends to reveal more about their past and their motivations.  We also see relationships develop as the characters learn that they have to work together.  Both Fiona and Rhys have to constantly prove that they are the leaders of this operation.  It manages to do all of this while still injecting a little bit of humor at the right times.  It's safe to say that the strong but light hearted humor remains intact from the borderlands series.<br /><br />Conversation branches have long term impacts on how your characters interact as each of them remember your choices and react appropriately.  Your actions can have very different outcomes as I've had certain character become disability or had big changes to their appearance when I made the wrong choices in different playthroughs.  And there are plenty of action sequences with quicktime events.  Most of the action sequences fit in well and keep you engaged.  They prevent you from putting the controller down just because you are listening to some dialogue.  Especially during some crucial moments of the story when you encounter a villain and the game really tests you to act true to your character.<br /><br />The graphics engine of Borderlands is getting dated by this point, but the art style still shines through.  Tales brings a lot more details in the environment as you get close views of everything through the cutscenes.<br /><br />The strong voice acting is probably the best part of the game and it's essential for an interactive story.  Troy Baker lends his classic voice for Rhys and Fiona is voiced by Laura Bailey.  Both veterans of voice acting in games.<br /><br />Tales From The Borderlands is fun, captivating, and manages to draw fans of shooters and interactive stories.  You definitely want to continue playing the series if you haven't picked up episode 3 and if you're new this would be a good time to jump on board and get up to speed.

It's a mix between the story and gameplay of Gearbox's classic shooter with a few recurring motifs from the Telltale Games style of storytelling.  In this review we're covering episode 3, but this video should apply both to people who are new to the Tales From The Borderlands series as well those who have only played the first episode or two.  I'll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum, but it's essential to talk about the narrative in this story driven game.  Let's take a look at Tales From The Borderlands and see if it's worth playing.<br /><br />Tales takes place in the Borderlands universe, but unlike the Borderlands games you aren't playing as a Vault Hunter.  You play as Rhys, a Hyperion employee who is trying to work his way to the top of the corporate ladder.  You also control Fiona who is a con artist working on Pandora.  The two characters come together and through unlikely odds become allies.  The story takes place after Borderlands 2 in the wake of  Handsome Jack's demise.  Yet he still has a presence in this game.  Ironically, these non-Vault Hunters turn their primary focuses to finding a Vault.<br /><br />Episode 3 is the middle of this five part series and it definitely shows.  Character development starts to flush out more as everyone tends to reveal more about their past and their motivations.  We also see relationships develop as the characters learn that they have to work together.  Both Fiona and Rhys have to constantly prove that they are the leaders of this operation.  It manages to do all of this while still injecting a little bit of humor at the right times.  It's safe to say that the strong but light hearted humor remains intact from the borderlands series.<br /><br />Conversation branches have long term impacts on how your characters interact as each of them remember your choices and react appropriately.  Your actions can have very different outcomes as I've had certain character become disability or had big changes to their appearance when I made the wrong choices in different playthroughs.  And there are plenty of action sequences with quicktime events.  Most of the action sequences fit in well and keep you engaged.  They prevent you from putting the controller down just because you are listening to some dialogue.  Especially during some crucial moments of the story when you encounter a villain and the game really tests you to act true to your character.<br /><br />The graphics engine of Borderlands is getting dated by this point, but the art style still shines through.  Tales brings a lot more details in the environment as you get close views of everything through the cutscenes.<br /><br />The strong voice acting is probably the best part of the game and it's essential for an interactive story.  Troy Baker lends his classic voice for Rhys and Fiona is voiced by Laura Bailey.  Both veterans of voice acting in games.<br /><br />Tales From The Borderlands is fun, captivating, and manages to draw fans of shooters and interactive stories.  You definitely want to continue playing the series if you haven't picked up episode 3 and if you're new this would be a good time to jump on board and get up to speed.  Leave a comment and let us know if you enjoy the Tales episodes or if you are more excited for a possible Borderlands sequel in the future.

The game key they gave me, however, was NOT for the deluxe edition, it was for the standard GOTY edition. The base game was still playable, but I only had the two major expansions available to play (Knights of the Nine & Shivering Isles)‚Äîthe other addons were not installed. I rechecked everything‚Äîit's not like I've never clicked the wrong thing by mistake‚Äîbut my purchase history was very clear that I bought Deluxe, not standard. (And I definitely paid the higher price for the addons!)<br /><br />This turned into a tech support black hole. Amazon told me to contact Steam. Steam told me that only Amazon could help me.<br /><br />Now, yes, the game was priced quite cheaply, and I probably only paid about $5 extra for the additional content I didn't get, but I'd played Oblivion before and, IMO, the DLCs enhanced the game considerably. If you're on the fence about whether to get the Deluxe or the standard GOTY, I'd choose Deluxe every time (especially since the extra content is so inexpensive compared to the base game). The game itself is great fun, even though Skyrim has me spoiled graphics-wise, and for the money, Oblivion is a tremendous source of entertainment. If I were rating just the game, I'd probably have given it four stars.<br /><br />Normally, I wouldn't put something like this in a review, since it's a customer service issue more than it is an issue with the game itself. However, since I got such a runaround from everyone involved, I want to make sure everyone's aware that this is a problem. Now, I have no idea whether it's happening to everyone‚ÄîI'd have expected to see a bit more outrage if it were‚Äîbut I'm definitely not the only one. There's a customer question related to this same issue on this page, and googling the problem sent me to several forums where various people were seeking help. I eventually got it resolved; Steam revoked my game code, I've emailed Amazon CS for a refund, and I repurchased it through the Steam store. (Successfully, I might add; I got the DLCs.) Steam made it clear to me that they were making a huge exception by doing so, so I wanted to get this warning out there as others may not be as &#34;successful&#34; as I was.<br /><br />So to be clear, Oblivion is a great game. If you're wanting the Deluxe GOTY edition, however, I strongly recommend that you not purchase it through Amazon and go through Steam instead. (As of this moment, the prices are identical on both sites, but two weeks ago when I bought the game, Amazon was somewhat cheaper. If you do end up buying from Amazon, be aware that you may not get a code for the game you purchased‚Äîand if you don't, getting the problem corrected is like pulling teeth.<br /><br />Good luck.solved; Steam revoked my game code, I've emailed Amazon CS for a refund, and I repurchased it through the Steam store.

It's not a bad game but I personally found it less fun than the original. There are some perks. There are vampires and paparazzi follow you around and people will ask you for your autograph. You can get VIP club access with the more stars you have. If you do anything considered &#34;scandalous&#34; in public people will judge you for it. You can go to City Hall and sue for defamation to clear your name. You can buy night clubs and redesign them however you want. There are lots of things to like about this game. I think the new furniture is awesome and I really like the new clothes! But there are a few things that make it less enjoyable than it could potentially be.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />NIGHTCLUBS. The night clubs are fairly vacant. You also can't fire your bartender if he's terrible at his job. I found throwing destination parties to be difficult because no one sticks around long enough for your bartender to get around to finish making their drinks. Sure you can manipulate other sims to meet and greet each other, but the party seems to be over so quickly you hardly have a chance to enjoy the extra features that come with this expansion. There's only one bartender on duty and he takes so long to get one plate of food out it's hardly worth the effort to feed your starving guests. I tried making food ahead of time for everyone but the process is still too slow for you to fully enjoy a night of real &#34;partying.&#34; I feel like I'm rushing to get to the point before everyone gives up and goes home.<br /><br />NOT FOR BIG FAMILIES. I moved my successful 8-member family to the city of Late Night. I converted a fancy 1br, 1ba loft into a 4 bedroom mini-mansion on the outskirts of town because the most rooms for any preset living space has is 1 or 2br max. I was rich enough to partner with other companies and bought out a few businesses to keep more income flowing. I redecorated everything made this house my own. But I soon learned that managing the lifestyles of a family this size is near impossible.<br /><br />Whereas Sims 3 encouraged growing families, this expansion doesn't support them very well. Just for the convenience of travel time, it's better to live within the city limits, but high rise penthouses barely have enough room to squeeze in 1 kid (I can't even imagine having twins or grandkids in the same space). I married off the youngest generation, got them all pregnant and moved them out one by one. I let the grandparents die and moved my eldest child into a penthouse with her new husband. Though their nightlife was more manageable, I did find a lot of downtime, in which I spent fastforwarding through work, sleep, or skill building.<br /><br />KIDS. Like I said, it's a challenge to build a sizable family and manage their nighttime lifestyles. However I quickly noticed your kids are practically useless until they reach the Young Adult stage. If you're living in a house, the kids can enjoy plenty of outdoor activities and help with chores and errands their busy parents can't handle. However, because of curfew you really can't start building relationships with other sims until their old enough to hit the town after school and work. Socializing can be a chore for a kid in a penthouse because waiting for elevators can eat up a good chunk of playtime. It can take an hour for a kid to get from his bed to his bike.",2015-06-26

7068,US,52236365,R2FNXT14PR66JU,B00ZQ3KZ7Y,N,N,Pretty good.,"&#34;Kholat&#34; is a fictional game based upon the real-life mystery of &#34;The Dyatlov Pass Incident&#34;. The Incident itself is one of the most compelling unsolved mysteries I have ever read about. If you are interested in such things, I highly recommend checking out a few books on the subject, many of which are available right here at Amazon. Be careful, though. Some are better than others, so it pays to read a few reviews. A lot of the facts presented in this game are real, but for the most part, the game has been fictionalized. Understandable, as the developers did need to make this work as an interactive game, and not a movie.<br /><br />The question most gamers will ask is: Does this game really work well as a game, rather than a simple walking simulator? Well, yes and no. For the most part, it is a walking and running simulator (you'll be doing a bit of fleeing for your life here). You basically traverse a generously non-linear path from one point to another, picking up scraps of paper revealing the horror that has come before you. I spent the first two hours of the game simply trying to figure out how to best use the compass and map, and deciding where I wanted to go, getting the bejeezus scared out of me, changing my mind, and going another direction, knowing that sooner or later I'd need to return again to be scared again.<br /><br />This game is drop-dead gorgeous. The snow and wind effects are simply unmatched. I shivered in my chair playing this. You start out at a train station in a small town at the beginning of a blizzard. It nearly felt too cold to play. From there, you eventually end up at the famed camp site and tent of the original expedition. The game uses Unreal Engine 4. I cannot attest as to how well it will run on lesser hardware, but on mine, it runs fine for the most part. I've got all my settings cranked to ultra, and I'm running it my monitor's native resolution of 2560 x 1440. My specs: Core i7 870, 8 gigs system ram, and a GTX 970 with 4 gigs ram. I am getting anywhere between 30 and 60 frames per second. I imagine it would run fine on much lesser hardware if you had a more normal resolution and set the settings down accordingly.<br /><br />Is there much of a game here? Not really, although there are more gaming moments than in other walking sims. You will be avoiding AI creatures, and running from them if your avoidance fails. You will be searching out as many notes and facts as you can find. And you will be attempting to navigate with a map that doesn't show you exactly where you are. You must deduce your location by using your compass along with the notes you have found (which the map does show you, but only the found notes; not the notes you haven't found).<br /><br />So, while &#34;Kholat&#34; may not be the most challenging of games, there are a few gaming elements. However for me, the main thing I look at is how well it conveys atmosphere. And in that regard, it passes with flying colors. The locations are stunning, the feeling of being lost is real, and the sense of wandering to the unknown is palpable. I bought it on GOG with intention of playing a game that would frighten me. The lack of 'true' gaming elements didn't bother me, and I am pleased with my purchase. There were a lot of slower-paced periods, but those were never boring to me, as I was primarily wandering around with a sense of awe at my surroundings. This is not a point-and-click adventure; rather you explore the world in a gorgeous real-time 3D engine. Your heart will race at times, but you may want to think twice if you are easily bored.with 4 gigs ram. I am getting anywhere between 30 and 60 frames per second.

I've only played the career mode and not the multiplayer so I can't really comment on multiplayer at the moment.  In a nut shell if you've enjoyed Forza, Gran Turismo and other racing games I think you'll have fun with Project Cars.  If you are heavy into customizing to get that extra speed or handling you may be disappointed.  Graphics, gameplay, the various tracks, really make this game replay ability shine in my opinion.  You can change the AI difficulty so you can back it off if the game to gets too frustrating.  I only knocked off one star because I like the ability to upgrade the cars, like the engine, tires, etc..<br /><br />Amazon limits the size of the video so I've uploaded the full review on Youtube.  I bought Mirillis Action on Steam and wanted to try it out making a video, so I decided to make one for Project Cars.  It'll be rather rough but I still hope it helps in the review.

This card is the same cost as if you paid it separately over 2 months on a CC but, this is BETTER if you don't want to accidently pay for time you do not use, I did waste some of my time but only 2 weeks of my free time..... This is better than worrying about keeping money on your credit card and worries about data theft, this will be the safest way to get your game time.<br /><br />However if you can only pay by a check your only option is to buy the physical card that has to be shipped to you and I suggest you buy it with 2 weeks to spare in case there are problems with shipping out plus if you are not a prime member the free shipping options take a week to get to you. Now bear in mind this is a time card not a bonus code or Collector edition code. This product does as it advertises and gives you 60 days. Plus be careful if you are going to stack these codes you can only prepay for 6 months (180 days) so if you buy 3 of these and you have time left use 1 of the codes and look at the days left if you have less than 120 or less days then you can add the 3rd one. But the max is 180 days do not put the 3rd code on until you are 120 days or less out from the end of the prepaid time.<br /><br />In addition, you now get veteran rewards by the total days subscribed not time played. So if you are a new player and you add 2 cards you will get the rewards for those days Ranks 1 2 and 3 for the first 120 days the next card you put on will give you the 180 days (Rank 4) rewards the 270 day reward (rank 5) rewards will come on after the next 2 cards are added When I add this code I will be 30 days shy of rank 5 and I cannot add another code for a bit because I will have around 127 days left so I have to wait until I am 120 or less to add the next code.<br /><br />Again, this is the SAFEST way to pay to play because with all the websites being hacked having your credit card information on your account isn't safe with the fact that places like SONY has proven that. Also, this is also a good way to give a gift code to a friend/family member who plays.ith the fact that places like SONY has proven that.

I'm about 20% through the main story line, and well it is kinda like the previous 2 Batmans, reskinned, but they have added a whole bunch of new content, and components.<br />There are many different players to use, I've seen others complain it isn't as many as Lego batman, well so what? How many people do you honestly need to play with. 10 is too many in my opinion, for a game with the main character in the title. If you want more variety go play The Sims.<br /><br />Yes you use the batmobile a lot, which I found annoying at first, but it really adds a new dimension to the game once you get the hang of it. I think they got the physics perfect, take note WatchDogs. Driving around town in a super fast tank, driving through trees and smashing cars, its fun in its own regard.<br />My only complaint about the batmobile is how everyone mostly disappears when you arrive in it. I guess that makes sense though, I would hide too.<br /><br />The combat while similar to the previous 2 batmans has a number of new very powerful moves. I suspect there may be larger swarms of enemies further into the game that will benefit from some of them.<br /><br />My one complaint is the death taunt scene. I get that the taunt is the point, but it gets annoying if you get stuck on one part and have to listen to one guy say 3 different phrases over and over and over again.<br /><br />All in all I think it's a good game, and will recommend buying and playing it.",2015-06-25

7131,US,21657092,RMIBOGKI2YVS1,B00FPQFVPI,N,N,This Thief game SUCKS!,"I hated this stupid game! On the YouTube video &#34;Game Sins | Everything Wrong With Thief In Fifteen Minutes&#34; they focused on all the details and not the overall failure of this game. They mentioned Garrett's eye being a different color and being able to see in the dark. They obviously aren't fans or would have known that Constantine/Trixter stole it in The Dark Project and the Hammers fabricated him the mechanical one you see now.  However, the real sin of this game is that it simply ISN'T a &#34;Thief&#34; game. Nothing about it is familiar except Garrett's name and Basso the Box man. The city is void of Hammer's, Mechanist, and Zombies. The story line doesn't pull you in the way the first 3 games did and lacks the &#34;Thief&#34; feel too it. I agree about the load screens and how annoying they aren't since many of them didn't lead to anywhere exciting and speaking of exciting THAT is exactly what this game truly lacked...excitement. The first 3 games kept you wanting more. More of the story as well as the action. The story in this game was almost non-existent since you didn't really care about it to begin with because it was meaningless. I wish they would have employed writers or consultants from the first 3 games to collaborate on this one. I also hated the herky-jerky playing like every time I took down a guard with my black jack the game would freeze up for a while or if there was a lot going on in the screen shot the game would slow down and jerk around. But overall the game possessed that same lifelessness that turned me off to Dishonored. This Thief game to me has a lot of similarities to that one. As a matter of fact I quit and uninstalled this Thief game after the idiotic and endless &#34;running through the burning city&#34; fiasco that had nothing to do with the spirit of the Thief games. This game was soooo disappointing because so much of this game lacked what Thief fans expected which was simply...another ‚Äútrue‚Äù Thief game. Maybe Eidos should have focused more on the story and character development while remaining true to the genre then a bunch of lame graphics and effects that added absolutely nothing to this game. But then again...what can you expect from a bunch of Canadians. ;)",2015-06-25

Since the release version of this game is still pretty new, there are bugs that need to be patched, so this is a major issue.  For anyone that has already bought it here.

So here is a brief synopsis from a person that has maybe picked up a controller 2 or 3 times in the past 10 years...<br /><br />Story of a group of young adults that are drafted into a Militia to fight off an army that is trying to invade their land for some special fuel rocks or something (think oil, or other energy commodities).  Throughout the adventures, you get troops, tanks, and a storyline that is pretty on the nose for a fantasy tropescape.  Love, duty, and of course social discourse...it's got it all.  It's not a role playing game.  It's not a first person shooter.  Definitely not a World of Warcraft type of game either.  It's a SUPER tamed down version of all three.  Again, as a non gamer, a perfect game for me.  Not too hard, not too easy.<br /><br />So originally, I played this on my roommate's PS3 when I was laid out after surgery, and got hooked on this game, within the first few minutes that I had played.  I never play video games, so obviously if you are an avid gamer that likes first person shooters, or sports or anything along those lines, this may not be the game for you.  But for a person that likes strategy, and tactics, and also a pretty creative story plot line, this is a game for you.  It was perfect for me, because I was literally sitting on the couch, and not able to move anywhere.  It's easy to play, and relatively forgiving for the non gamer.  A couple years later, came across it on Amazon for the PC.  I have a PC, and I have Amazon Prime, and I was bored...so here I am on round 2.  I would suggest getting a controller for it as well.  It's a lot easier to play with that.<br /><br />So whether you are an avid strategy gamer, or a person that is hopped up on pain pills spending 4 days at home on the couch...I think you'll enjoy it!",2015-06-25

7164,US,19883731,R2707O2JOYHJXZ,B004BLK0CM,N,N,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.,"Wow!!! I am absolutely flabbergasted by all these reviewers, gushing about such an idiotic and stupid game called Governor of Poker Premium!!! The maker or the makers of this game should have presented this game to the public under the title of &#34;Ultimate Garbage Poker II.&#34; And not under its current title, instead. Playing in an actual poker tournament, if it is played, either in a Casino environment, or on the Web, requires not only a great deal of skill, but also it involves a small amount of luck. Now being said that, the producers of an electronic game, indeed are required to thoroughly research all the basic protocols, odds, and the existing rules in regard to the game that they are about to present it to the public. Otherwise they need to be 100 percent sure of their calculated odds, and become certain of, that it is truly up to chance, and not favoritism. Since nothing will sink an electronic game faster, to the bottom of gaming markets, than when the  players feel they have been cheated. In order to play this game, at the start you need to establish your character first. Either male, or female. Pick a name (you create) and then finally the hat color. Then the game offers you a small amount of free chips. Your job is to travel from your point of origin to the next town, and participate in a tournament. Win, buy the town and move on to the next stop, and so forth....at the end if you are victorious, you will be appointed the new Governor of the State of Texas. Granted it is fun and time consuming, but it is not challenging!!! Due to this fact that the creators of this game have stacked the odds against the live players. Despite the fact, that I played this game for 72 straight hours, with a few breaks here and there of course, and was able to overcome all the alleged challenges and obstacles and be called the Governor of Texas the maximum allowed 10 times, but at the end I found this game to be absolutely disgusting, and in a simpler term, a ripoff. This game has plenty flaws. But the biggest flaw based on my opinion is; it lacks integrity. So allow me to dissect it for those of you who are thinking to purchase this game. The character created for this game by the makers, all are whole bunch of hat-wearing male and female, who speak with variety of accents. In essence they are nothing but talking-emoji's. At the start of the game, of course they all sound cute, and interesting. But eventually as the game continues, they start to sound ridicules and annoying. Since they all start to repeat the same conversation again and again and again. Such as &#34;I am shaken.&#34; or &#34;too much to bet.&#34; While the ante simply is only $2.00. Then there is the matter of mocking you. Imagine you are playing in an actual Texas-hold-them tournament in a casino. One of the player, let us call him or her player X, raises the pot with more than a few thousands right of the bat. Indeed player X, is holding pocket aces. Naturally majority of players with weak pocket cards have no choice, but to fold. Except one player which we now call him or her player Y, brazenly re-raises the pot with a few more thousands, forcing the player X, which is holding pocket aces to go all-in. Of course player Y has already committed two third of his or her chips, so has no choice but to continue with the play. Both players now have to face-up their cards and show it to the rest of players, while waiting for the dealer to deal the five cards which is required in determining, who the winner is going to be. As I said, player X is holding pocket Aces. But wouldn't you be surprised to discover that the player Y has pocket unsuited 7 and 2!!!! The first thing coming to one's mind is that the player Y is either drunk, on drugs or has no clue how to play Poker? Well, it is a sure bet for Player X who is holding pocket aces. Right? Wrong. The dealer delivers the community cards. (the first three cards.) it is an ace, and then two more sevens. Player X now hasa nice full house. Next would be the flop. A two shows up. Wow the player Y also made a full house, but not good enough. But wait there is the River. Here comes the third seven. Shocking. Player Y has made four of a kinds, beating the full house of Player X, getting him out of the game. But what is more shocking, is to hear player Y say. &#34;I knew, I was good.&#34; What would be the first thing which comes to one's mind? It would be, either the player Y is in cahoots with the dealer, or has crystal ball? Few more rounds, and then the same player (Y) decides to raise the pot. This time another player who is holding pocket kings, angrily pushes all-in. Again player Y calls the bet, and shows his or her two cards. Again he or she is holding pocket 4, and a 9 unsuited. dealer deals the customary five cards one after another. The first card in the community again is a king. Sigh of relief. The player already is holding three kings. What could be better? Since there are no nines or fours among the first three cards. Flop is not a 9, and River is not a 9 or four either. So the player with three kings is going to win. Right? Wrong again. The three kings are club, spade, and king of heart. But there are four cards which has been delivered by the dealer are all diamonds. And the player (Y) pocket cards which is only a 4, and a 9, due to having a 4 of diamond beats the three kings of the other player, getting him out of the game. Again, shocking? Yes. But what is more shocking when you hear the player (Y) saying. &#34;That is called, Skill, boys.&#34; I do not know about you? But to me that is insulting. And if it continues further and further? What do you think it will happen to such a brazen and disrespectful player? Well if you do not know by now, by the end of the game, the player (Y) most likely would be spending his or her winning in the office of his or her proctologist. That is why I believe Governor of Poker Premium II lacks integrity. Because that is how this gametreats you. The makers of this game are so obsessed with their talking -emojis, that deliberately have made sure that these emojis be the winner of the game, no matter what? I am a retired mathematician, who had the good fortune of teaching math and logic at the University level for almost 40 years. So I have simplified things for you, if you are still interested to purchase and play this game. These are the popular pocket cards that are mostly dealt. 4 and 9 unsuited.  If you as a player decide to play your cards. Your chances of making a hand and winning the pot: * Probability for you of making three of a kind, beating the emojis and winning the pot: 0.043688 For emojis, with the same two cards, the probability of making of three of a kind, beating you: 22.3 * Probability for you to make four of a kind, beating emojis and winning the pot: 0011259 For emojis, with the same two cards, the probability of making four of a kind, beating you: 17.76 * Probability for you to make a full house to beat the emojis and winning the pot: 0.022241 For emojis with the same two cards, the probability of making full house, beating you: 16.93  Pocket Queen and Seven, unsuited: * Probability of you making Three of a kind, beating emojis and winning the pot: 3.0012 Probability of making three of a kind, with the same two cards for emojis, beating you and winning the pot: 14.623 * Probability of you making straight, and beating emojis, and winning the pot: 4.7032 Probability of making straight with the same two cards for emojis, beating you and winning the pot: 23.179  Any pocket unsuited cards: * Probability of you making flush, beating the emojis, and winning the pot: 3.7915   Probability of emojis making flush with the same two cards, beating you and winning the hand: 37.6543  Pocket Aces:  * Probability of making any combination of a hand, beating the emojis and winning the pot: 11.3246   Probability of making any combination of a hand with the same pocket aces for emojis, beatingyou, and winning the pot: 67.4532  Shall I continue? I better not. I am sure you all get the picture. Now the ball is in your court. I see some of the people are so fascinated by the audio and video of this game that have forgotten as to why they have purchased this game to begin with. Do we really care about the audio and the video, or do we care about the substance and the integrity of a game? You tell me. Some viewers have drooled over how one can purchase hats while playing this game. How silly. By the way, when I started to play this game, I chose to play the pro section of the game which contains bonuses. So, in all fairness I have no clue about the normal part of the game, and how the odds are distributed?",2015-06-25

In the museum, you get to an elevator and are essentially stuck.  The reason why is you have to fire a negative charge at the electric motor.  The problem?  You have to fire it with the middle mouse button, which is impossible if you have a laptop with a touchpad.  So, you have to go into the game's INI file and re-write the code to assign the Middle Mouse Button to another key (which took me forever to figure out how to do seeing as how there are three different INI files which feature the Middle Mouse Button).<br /><br />2.  Steering while gliding in the demon challenge is impossible.  The game itself states that directional commands are used with &#34;W A S D&#34;, but they do nothing.  The arrow keys do nothing.  The only way to steer is by holding the mouse buttons and trying to swipe your fingers across the touchpad...all the while holding down the Space Bar and either a Left Control or &#34;V&#34; button.  It is the height of frustration to get through 20 percent of a game and to be confronted with a point through which you cannot progress due to poorly designed controls.<br /><br />3.  Whatever you do, do not upgrade to &#34;Critical Strikes&#34;.  The skill wrecks the combat system.  After choosing the upgrade, Batman keeps swinging at walls while enemies are in the opposite direction.

It brings everything we can expect from an HD version with improved graphics and a few new features.  But is it worth picking up an old re-released game for new fans or even for the hardcore Devil May Cry Fans?  Let's find out in the Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition Review.<br /><br />We're going to focus primarily on the new additions to the game as I'm sure there's already a lot of reviews on the original Devil May Cry 4.  The clearest improvement in the Special Edition is the graphics upgrade.  It runs in 1080p 60 frames per second on Xbox One and PS4.  The PC version has no frame rate cap and you can definitely crank up the graphics.  It looks crisp, clear, and smooth.  There's still evidence that it's a last gen game from the textures, to the models, and the level design.  But it's definitely a big improvement and it's a necessity for a modern HD remaster.<br /><br />The biggest draw of the Special Edition are the new playable characters.  You can play as Nero and Dante who were in the original version.  But now you can play as Vergil, Trish, and Lady who all have different weapons, handling, and special abilities.  Devil May Cry is all about the playstyle and how you handle the combos.  So playing as different characters definitely adds a new dimension to the game.<br /><br />Players are really excited to play as Vergil who is based on his rendition from Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, combined with elements of his playstyle from DmC.  He has two different swords and special huge fist weapons.  His special abilites has him transform.  He moves fast and his sword play is really precise.  He's really a blast to play as.<br /><br />Then there's Lady and Trish.  Lady specializes in long range firearm based combat.  Her signature weapon is the Kalina Ann which is a huge rocket launcher.  She has a grappling hook which lets her control enemies and also rappel up in certain platforming sections.  She handles much differently from Dante and Nero.  She's more of a ranged weapons character.  Her melee attacks are very slow but deal a decent amount of damage.  Trish utilizes a Sparada Sword and her pistols.<br /><br />Each of the three new characters also receive their own story cutscenes which makes it feel like playing a different character has meaning and it's not just a re-skin.  However Lady can only play on Nero's missions and Trish can only play on Dante's missions.  Vergil can play on any mission.  That's a little confusing, but it keeps the storylines distinct and adds replayability.  For those who really love replaying the levels and grinding for high score, it's definitely a great value to be able to play the different characters.<br /><br />For the really hardcore, there's Legendary Dark Knight mode.  Which is an extremely high difficulty challenge.  They multiply the amount of enemies and also bring in tougher enemies even early in the game.  You can see here side by side the difference in enemy count is huge.  And they are much more aggressive.  You definitely don't want to go in to Legendary Dark Knight Mode without experience and without all of the upgrades.  I couldn't get far in Legendary Dark Knight mode, but I can see how it would be a lot of fun for someone very experienced and it's actually easier to rack up combos since the enemy count is higher.<br /><br />The one downside is the additional DLC.  You're already re-buying an old game and then they want you to spend more money just to unlock new modes and costumes.  This is so unnecessary, these things should really be included with the game.  The whole reason someone would buy this game is to replay levels with new characters and challenges and they put a barrier to that by placing some of that content in the DLC.  And although the game is a pretty good package it's really just anexcuse to get this game out on the new consoles.  And to get it out on Steam a second time.  It's kind of ridiculous that the old one is there just five dollars cheaper than the original.<br /><br />Despite those few quarrels I think the game is a good package and Devil May Cry 4 is a fun game that rewards skill.  If you're a hardcore player, the extra characters and legendary dark knight mode add a new dimension of depth.  If you're a new player this could be an easy way to check out the series seeing as it's only about a $25 package depending on whether or not you can justify also purchasing the DLC.  They made right decision keeping the price low and not overcharging for an HD remaster.  So you may want to give Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition a shot.

Additionally, some of the more advanced features had absolutely no help in the game (like how to maximize the cow productivity, etc.).  game tips and tutorials need work, and need events in the game to keep it interesting (disasters, diseases, drought).  Having a way to navigate quickly to parts of the map would be helpful, along with being able to choose which vehicle to transport to instead of tabbing through your inventory would be nice as well.<br /><br />But the graphics, vehicles, and equipment were all done very well",2015-06-24

7227,US,27288562,R7AMWI97WOIOH,B00A2Z50KI,N,N,"... I - III was cheap and the reviews were good, so I decided to buy them","The price for AC I - III was cheap and the reviews were good, so I decided to buy them. The biggest complaint I have about them is that there are a lot of cutscenes and you will hear the voice of one character speaking. After the sound stops you can see there mouth moving, but there is no sound. This goes on for 3 -4  times longer than the audio went for. When your avatar walks he takes 1 step every 2 seconds. Running is 1 stop per second and running all out is 1.5 steps per second. If your avatar take 3 foot per step this equates to 1 MPH walking speed, 2 MPH running and 3 MPH full out. I have seen video on Youtube  from Xbox and Playstation where talking and moving seems to be much faster, but for some reason they have decided to run everything in slow motion for the PC, so that it takes 3 or 4 times longer to play at the expense of the fun. I mistakenly thought people bought video games to have fun.   The controls are absolutely terrible, the worst I have ever seen. In AC III. There are muzzle loading guns which take a long time to load. A faster way would be to drop the empty gun and pick up a loaded one. The screen says push E to drop, pick up or swap weapons, but I often have to hit E 5 or 6 times before The computer complies. There are two things that cause your avatar to turn. One is to slide the mouse across a surface. The other is automatically done by the computer. When you turn your avatar to one side or the other or run over rough ground the computer will make your character more. You never know how much the computer will add to the characters movement and often you overturn and have to turn back. Often you again overturn and have to turn back. It is very difficult to run in a straight line. Other times there are keys I hit the computer ignores or misinterprets.   This is not really a game it is an interactive animated movie where your options are severely limited. The first half hour after you start is a cut scene where you ride in a vehicle with no conversation and do some spelunking with a little bit of walking under your own power. Then a half hour mandatory tutorial where you practice stuff the computer will never let you use in the game even if you decide to try them. You then have a 45 minute cutscene at the playhouse where you do some walking and climbing and then do an assassination by cutscene. You also get to do what Ubisoft calls lockpicking, but is actually lock breaking. Apparently they believe that locks from the 1700s were so complex that they could not be picked, but had to be broken. You then get a 15 minute cut scene about why your avatar should go to America. Then a 2 hour and 15 minute cutscene of his sailing to America where you can do a little walking around and get into one fistfight and one sword fight. Finally you reach Boston and can start the game after 4.5 hours of monumental boredom you at last can play the game er interactive animated movie.   At one point in the interactive animated movie I needed to eavesdrop on some people to get a clue to what I should do. The screen says I should do so from hiding. Since they were close to one building I decided to climb it and listen to them from the roof. The computer would not let me climb in this particular situation. I then crossed to the other side of the street and tried not to be seen. The computer took over my avatar and had him walk right up to the people he was eavesdropping on and stand there staring at them. I was not allowed to move my avatar away. They quickly realized I was eavesdropping and attacked me even though they were not telling any state secrets. I had to replay this eavesdropping section over several times before I got through and every time the computer would take over my avatar and move it right up to the people I was eavesdropping on. The time I got through it I was standing  between two men at least far enough away from the talkers so they would not attack me, but they would not continue with their talk. I moved myavatar a hair, for him it would be a move of less than 6 inches and the computer decided that minimal amount of movement took me from someone they knew was eavesdropping to someone they did not notice and they began talking. There were numerous occasions where the computer took over my character and had him attack people for no reason or to change the weapon I had readied. I was in a fort with 5 allies and 13 enemies. The rules were I had to assassinate the enemies and free come captives without being detected. I decided to kill two who were near where I was and far from all the other enemies. I walked up to them and stabbed one of them. Then I tried to stab the other. Even though the computer showed my ready weapon was the dagger I had used to stab the first one the computer had me punching the second one in the face. I kept hitting the attack button hoping the computer would allow me to use my readied weapon the dagger, but kept punching him. It occurs to me that it is very, very difficult to not be detected by someone you are repeatedly punching in the face. He detected me and the game was reloaded at the last checkpoint. I tried 5 or 6 times to kill these two with the same result. I then turned my sights to other enemies and was detected time after time because The computer had me punching them instead of stabbing them, The computer took over my avatar and had him do something stupid, I would kill an enemy and be spotted usually because I tried to get into a hiding spot and my avatar hung up out in the open and other problems. This game had far to many problems to be fun and you would be best advised to buy a game from Bethesda or replay one of their games you have already played.",2015-06-24

7236,US,20481835,R2C6RA68LSD246,B00ZJMS13M,N,N,"Great new additions, but needs some more balancing","Firstly, I bought the game through PSN directly, so that's why Amazon can't verify the purchase.<br /><br />The new characters are fun to play. Vergil has a larger moveset than he did in Devil May Cry 3, and Lady offers a completely new style of play with her primary method of attack being stunlocks and ranged attacks. Haven't gotten to play Trish yet, when I do I'll update the review. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because some of the boss fights weren't redone for the new characters. For instance, the Agnus Window fight in chapter 6 with Vergil is an absolute nightmare. Look up a video to see why. The fight with Credo in chapter 8 is also much more difficult to defeat with Vergil. For both of these fights I had to come up with repetitive, unorthodox methods. However Bael and Ekhidna where much easier as Vergil. There is a bit of a difficulty imbalance playing as Vergil, but not so much as to warrant anything less than 4 stars. One thing that they did that I appreciated a lot was, unlike in Devil May Cry 3, all characters are on the same save file, so when you obtain an item or blue orb or what have you with any one character, all the other characters have that item. Key items exempt. However you must still complete each stage with each character, respectively, which I really like.",2015-06-24

7296,US,452646,R3L7KM7LTDPYDC,B00XJP6TEO,N,N,Fun platforming with some unique twists,"Inside My Radio has taught me something very important for someone that says that they love rhythm games; I have horrible rhythm. Think you have rhythm just because you are good at guitar hero or DDR?  Imagine playing those games without the shapes scrolling towards the 'hit the button now' bar.  Still sounding too simple? Add in the fact that this is a platformer. Now we have added something a bit more unique to the mix.<br /><br />So imagine a two dimensional platformer akin to Mario, Thomas Was Alone, or 100,000 indie games hitting the market lately. The controls are simple, smooth, responsive, but there's a catch: you can only ground-pound, dash or jump on the beat. Why? Because if you do it before or after the beat, your character will grimace horribly and do absolutely nothing at all.  This makes timing absolutely crucial to success.<br /><br />While almost all platformers require a sense of timing, Inside My Radio definitely adds another dimension to it. If this mechanic sounds frustrating, that is because it certainly has the potential to be. Fear not, however - they have an a dummy-setting for people like myself who seem to be lacking the rhythm to succeed. What this does is allow two circles rotate around your character, and when they meet, it is an indicator that it is a beat.<br /><br />The key selling point to this game is not the story, it's not even really the responsive controls that were done just right, or the way that it adds new environment items for you to interact with at a steady pace, but instead, the music. Ranging from what sounded like 80's funk to rock, touch of electronica, I enjoyed listening to this game more than I truly appreciated playing it. That is saying something, given that I thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay.<br /><br />One of the other hooks meant to keep you interested are the puzzles built into Inside My Radio. Naturally these puzzles are built around mechanics related to the beat, only interacting with an item on specific beats, instead of simply every one. Changing hazards such as disappearing platforms are trained into your brain like one of Pavlov's dogs, wherein you hear a specific sound byte and you know you need to jump by the end of it.<br /><br />I ended up finishing this game after about three hours, and while there is a time-attack mode, you can go back and revisit various scenes and try to do better in them. I just call it, 'jukebox mode', where you load up time-attack mode and just let the music play in the background. It's a fun title, a bit on the short side, and the story is bare-bones at best, but who plays rhythm games for the story anyhow?  Certainly not me.<br /><br />There is nothing here that is truly lacking, but there was still room for the game to grow and develop upon the mechanics that have been implemented. Inside My Radio provides plenty of action, but almost comes away feeling as though this could be the foundation of something more in future releases.ats, instead of simply every one.

7364,US,16936510,R1QS327MTAOV84,B00V5D3OHC,N,Y,Very Problematic Release!,"Update 7/3 -<br />I had noticed some graphical stuttering and FPS issues on the Mac client, but had chalked them up to server congestion and the 'newness' of the client. I expected a few quick patches to come out that would fix the issues. The game is playable, but it does suffer from some sever graphics issues and a few crashes. Graphically it reminds me of playing a game released in 2015 on a decade old machine - it's like the hardware just can't handle it. I should note that I have a late 2013 Retina Display MBP with dedicated graphics - I don't expect to run a game with completely maxed settings, but I shouldn't be having graphical issues at middle settings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems that SQEX jumped the gun on this release, they left an official statement for Mac Users:http://sqex.to/GgVn<br /><br />I look forward to reinstalling the Mac version once it is updated (next OS release that has a better Mac graphics engine won't come out until fall 2015 or so), until then I'll just stick to my PS4. I requested a refund via online chat with Amazon and will update the review if there are any refund issues.<br /><br />----Original Review----<br />Will update once I (hopefully) get resolution -<br /><br />Same issue as others. The code provided doesn't work for Mac, I contacted Amazon support and explained the issue and they issued me a new code, same problem - the code shows as invalid when you try to register for the Mac license, but shows as valid if you put it in for the Windows client. The rep i spoke to was aware of the lack of Mac download instructions and just gave the vague 'we're working on it'.<br /><br />I bought this using Amazon gift cards, so refunding and repurchasing from SQEX isn't an option for me, I'll have to contact SQEX support now (per Amazon) to have them resolve, but their customer service isn't actually open until 12pm EST.<br /><br />**UPDATE 12PM EST**<br />I didn't end up having to contact SQEX to get this fixed. I rechecked just now on Amazon and my product key had changed from earlier. I wasn't sent any email confirming this or given any indication it was changing/fixed but the new key worked on the Mog Station to add the Mac license. It also added 30 days free game time (not sure if this is a glitch, a bonus for the inconvenience or because it's a bundle and you normally get 30 days for adding ARR to your account).<br /><br />Better yet - the installation instructions have been updated to now have the correct Mac Downloader link - which I can't even find on SQEX site: http://square.vo.llnwd.net/o2/ffxivhw/ffxiv_hw_installer.dmg<br /><br />Corrected to a 5/5 :)ny email confirming this or given any indication it was changing/fixed but the new key worked on the Mog Station to add the Mac license.

7383,US,16910537,R3NJE21NUCII5L,B002VBWIP6,N,Y,Typically saves me time and money vs. buying in a physical store. I can also reduce my credit card risk by pre-paying!,"I purchased a 12 month Xbox Live Gold membership for the first time on Amazon a couple years ago and I love the convenience.  I typically use the &#34;Online Game Code&#34; option which provides you with a code you enter on your Xbox or within your Xbox Live account.  This allows me to make the purchase and basically instantly redeem the code on my Xbox Live account. It's great if you need to quickly start, reactivate or extend membership without waiting for a physical card to arrive in the mail or without needing to run to the store to buy one. I also like using these prepaid cards or codes to pay for Xbox Live over paying with a credit card or debit card.  If you pay with a credit/debit card Microsoft typically automatically renews it when your subscription is up.  As a single dad I may not always have the required funds where they need to be when that happens. I don't like surprises and the associated fees that come with them. ;)  I prefer not having a credit card linked to my Xbox anyway because it helps prevent fraud and the kids can't &#34;accidentally&#34; purchase something.<br /><br />WHICH MEMBERSHIP LENGTH SHOULD YOU PURCHASE?<br />Xbox Live membership pre-paid cards/codes are available in 3 month, 12 month or 24 month subscriptions. I typically buy the 12 month and I'll explain why in a minute.<br /><br />The 3 months option is good if you're on a tight budget or if you're not sure you'll like Xbox Live. I typically avoid the 3 month option because it costs you much more in the long run.  If you pay for 12 months of Xbox Live using the 3 month option at $24.99 you'll pay $99.96 for a year of Xbox Live. For 3 cents more you could have purchased a two year subscription card! (Currently $99.99  That's crazy!<br /><br />I purchase the 12 month subscription because I know we'll want. . . no NEED . . . Xbox Live all year in our household.  The 12 month card saves me money over a monthly Credit Card billed subscription or the 3 month options.  In fact if you're patient, I know at least the 12 month memberships go on sale from time to time.  I think I scored my first one on Amazon for $39.99 which is about $20 off the normal price.<br /><br />If you've got extra cash burning a hole in your pocket you can also pony up the dough for a 24 month Xbox Live Gold membership and take advantage of the discount it offers.  I'm a bit too cheap and try to hold our household to too much of a budget to justify buying the $99.99 24 month subscription card/code.  It does save about $20 vs. buying two 12 month cards but the $19.99 it currently saves me isn't enough to justify the expense.  If your'e lucky enough to find these Xbox Live Gold membership cards/codes on sale you can always buy and redeem multiples. You can add them at any time and Microsoft allows you to stack them.  I believe you can redeem up to 3 years worth of Xbox Live Gold membership credits on your account at any one time.<br /><br />Since many parents/grandparents/adults may be considering buying this as a gift they might have questions. The information below should be helpful in these cases. If you're not new to Xbox Live Gold, just skip the rest of this review!<br /><br />WHAT THE HECK IS XBOX LIVE GOLD?:<br />To any parents, grandparents, adults and gamers that don't know what Xbox Live Gold is: it's basically an extra service that allows video game players to play with other players via the internet. Most of today's games are made to be enjoyed by playing them with and against other players online. The days where you sit on the couch and play with 1-2 other people are pretty much gone.  The sad truth is to get the most of their video games, Xbox One and Xbox 360 gamers need Xbox Live Gold. Xbox Live also allows players to access other features like online video etc but the main focus and benefit is online multiplayer gaming.<br /><br />A word of caution: Parents, adults, guardians. PLEASE monitor what your kids are doing. Just like you shouldn't turn your impressionable child loose on the internet without any supervision or guidance, you shouldn't turn them loose on Xbox Live.  People can chat and interact with each other via Xbox Multiplayer games, messages and more.  Many games allow players to create their own emblems, logos etc.  It should be no surprise that many people (adults and children) can't behave themselves.  Online interactions on Xbox Live Gold are largely out of the control of Xbox and the game developers. There are rules governing the actions of players online, but for the most part things are on the honor system.  Things ARE moderated to a certain extent but for the most part any disciplinary action is reactionary and comes long after violations of the Xbox Live terms of service.  For example, if they receive enough complaints, Microsoft/Xbox will take action against anyone who is acting inappropriately. Unfortunately this action is typically taken long after your child has been exposed to language or images you didn't want them to be exposed to.  Just know if your child plays online multiplayer games they WILL eventually hear adult language and sometimes worse. If you aren't comfortable with this do NOT let them use Xbox Live Gold.  You can supervise your child, change settings to reduce risks slightly, but in the end you can't control what other players say or do.nable child loose on the internet without any supervision or guidance, you shouldn't turn them loose on Xbox Live.

7391,US,10997344,R3OZ532FI07XP3,B00C7B0EXS,N,Y,Kasumi is a great addition to the team,"I played this DLC some time ago for Mass Effect 2 on Xbox. I have started playing Mass Effect again on P¬®C and decided to buy DLC slowly.<br /><br />The Kasumi DCL contains a small story that allows your character to recruit Kasumi, who is a mix of assassin, spy and saboteur into the group of characters who can be party members. Kasumi sports some really good abilities and the story, centered around a high society event has some fun twists, though it is a little short. I think you get this DLC just to add Kasumi to the mix of characters.<br /><br />The DLC is activated at an old Bioware website, and that was the main reason I bought this DLC was to try that the system was still working. The good news is that it is still there and it links this code to your Cerberus Network ID. You need to log at least once on the game main screen and the DLC is registered. Not much of a hassle, but I would have liked that EA had brought the Cerberus Network into Origin and not have to do this step.<br /><br />In any case, not the best DLC out there, specially given the scope and Quality of Mass Effect 2, but decent addition to the team.",2015-06-23

My one complaint is that it was very short, and lime another user said, I could have bought another game with longer game play for cheaper, but that isn't the point.

7414,US,50370060,R1W44D9G6RP3VG,B00V5D3OHC,N,Y,DO NOT BUY!,"I am rewriting my original set of issues with the game (which got solved) as very significant (and FAR worse) issues have come to light since then. I purchased the game from amazon.com, eventually getting it running. Spent hundreds of hours (over 200, am retired so had time) getting my character a few levels below max (56 from 60). The director of the game, a &#34;Yoshi P.&#34; (real name Naoki Yoshida) posted an &#34;apology&#34; for the state of the released game and said with NO equivocation that IF customers wanted their money back, they wold be given it. I was running a fairly burly tower, so it played fine for me, so I did NOT want that. However, after some communication between Square & amazon.com I was not a party to, amazon.com simply refunded everyone's money, giving me NO CHOICE like that I was &#34;promised.&#34; Spoke to amazon.com customer service, they said they were told by Square to refund all Mac purchasers. Called Square to explain the situation (they knew this had happened) but they took a hard line when I said I WOULD immediately give them BACK 60 bucks that got refunded. No deal. Was told by their customer support that I COULD purchase a Windows license to continue to play the game. At the time, I could not. Scrimped and saved for a good video card (senior citizen, fixed income, you get the picture), got it a month or so ago and went and got the PC version as I had set up a BOOTCAMP partition.   Long story, I tried to play that character I had put SO much effort into, eventually finding out that my account was not suspended, it was BANNED. The character is still there, it is still listed on their Lodestone site, but they refuse to &#34;un-ban&#34; me so I could play it. There is NO REASON for them to do this, it is simply being VINDICTIVE for something I had NO CONTROL over.  I have many friends who are now living in Japan so I understand a little bit about their culture... it is one bound by honor.  Said honor was what lead them to completelyrewrite the game because their first try was a disaster. So Mr. Naoki Yoshida, Yoshi P., your words, publicly posted have now caused you to LOSE HONOR as the company you are an executive of has 100% turned into a lie, I was NOT allowed to use the choice you gave me and in several attempts for Square to make the situation right, they have steadfastly refused to, choosing a vindictive approach instead.  It would make me happy if amazon.com chooses to not deal with this company that so easily screws over customers for no good reason other than being vindictive, but I doubt that would ever happen. SOMEONE really need to shame this company into not treating people so abominably. YOU are free to do what you think best, I can only tell you how this company operates so you are forewarned.",2015-06-23

Pre-order issues and no world issues ranging from log in to restricted access because their servers aren't able to handle too many players. This time it's worse because they've since condensed the worlds to a few due to so many dropping out on 1.0 release. I highly suggest avoiding this game and the expansion until servers and issues are resolved. See photo for the announced issues; these are just the announced. And before you request for help, it's never going to happen. Their billing and CS is beyond stupid. The link for the pre-order to sign-in doesn't even work. Thankfully I can use the regular account login to enter the code. How's that in your face?

This one was outsourced to the lower bidder.<br /><br />I tend to avoid calling games bad ports but once in awhile a game earns that reputation.  It runs very poorly even on high end systems.  I have two GTX 970's in SLI and a G-Sync monitor and it still has very noticeable frame rate drops.  It doesn't look nice either it easily could be confused for an xbox 360/ps3 game.<br /><br />Here's a list of everything that's happened to this series in the last few months:<br />- Game was delayed<br />- Batmobile collectors edition cancelled days before launch<br />- Limited edition delayed<br />- $40 Season pass (are you kidding me $100 total for a single player game?)<br />- Terrible PC port that was outsourced and locks the game at 30 FPS.<br />- Has Denuvo DRM ontop of already having steam DRM.,2015-06-23

Did not realize there was a bug in this expansion pack till after it was installed but through many forums and searches it would seem that in order to get past the lag glitch one must install a mod program.  I don't want to use third party software to play a game I paid good money for.  I shouldn't have to either.  EA needs to fix this issue but since they are trying so hard to sale us on Sims 4 doubt that will happen.  So while it is a good add on the glitch just kills it for me and I can not play Island Paradise an will have to stay out of this world.  At least I have some of the content added for other worlds I play from now on.<br /><br />Some say it is that the world is too big but others seem to think it is too much content.

7515,US,35711120,R13HGJS1DJ5NF3,B00WL6J5CK,N,N,"Boss fights are pathetic, and the game is short, but get it cheap and its worth a play.","This game pales in comparison to the new order.  Perhaps thats why it gets a lot of mediocre reviews.  Folks expect a certain level of enjoyment and its easy to disappoint if you have created something great before.<br /><br />I payed $10 for it on steam and while this game was fun, i beat it in under 10 hours while almost completely exploring my surroundings and doing all the nightmare missions.  And that was with occasionally starting over chapters to try stealthing through them.  Honestly If I had just run and gunned through I probably would of beat it in 6 hours or less.  This is in comparison to the 136 hours in Witcher 3 before finishing (also lots of exploring and side stuff).  So The Old Blood is short.<br /><br />But there are other issues to.  One prime example is that the AI is stupidly easy to fool or sometimes buggy.  They mostly have set pathing which is ok, except that i can just stroll around them in circles sometimes without a reaction... and if they see you (even on the harder difficulties), they startle but dont immediately respond giving you time to hide again.... and they go on their merry way.  But at other times they see you before you even have come around a corner or sound an alarm when you have not even been seen yet.<br /><br />Really the reason for 3 stars instead of 4 revolves around the boss fights which are all horribly designed.  One of them requires you to cheese to win (it is possible to beat without cheesing but only if you come into the fight with tons of ammo and the right guns), and one of them is just about getting headshots so if you know how to aim... easy.  The final boss fight was downright pathetic and honestly kinda ruined the game for me when I was at least having some fun.<br /><br />One final complaint.... the ending is kinda sudden and lacks feeling.  It kinda felt like I had finished a &#34;chapter&#34; and there should of been another one to come.  If you can get this game cheap... its worth a play.  But dont spend more then $10 on it.. because i barely felt it was worth that.  Its a $5 game for sure.<br /><br />4/10more then $10 on it.. because i barely felt it was worth that.  Its a $5 game for sure.<br /><br />4/10",2015-06-22

7592,US,26191600,R3149Q5R1BC7FS,B008MAZ0PU,N,Y,Good but...,"Graphics are good, large land mass. I love that the levels are relative so a 30th level character can still run around with a 10th level friend without overpowering him; your level is based on the zone you're in. Only thing is that, the personal side story is kind of corny and a lot of the NPCs are the same exact character, not enough variety. I hate to say it, but WoW still holds a soft spot in my MMORPG gamer heart. If you want an honest review, check out Angry Joe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax-_06Acj8Y",2015-06-21

High learning curve, but stick with it and you will get your wins in on multi-player and enjoy the game a lot more.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Games are short 20-45 minutes<br />AI is pretty decent in campaign<br />Multi-player works very well<br />Puts you in the seat of the commander, but allows for more individual control of units if you want<br />Cons:<br />Ultra - High learning curve. Experienced players will annihilate you every time and with so many variables, units, distance, los, experience for units, etc. you can get discouraged easily and demotivate the multi-player community.<br />Multi-player community could use some additional support from Focus: Seems completely player driven",2015-06-20

Why give it only 1 star then?  Normally new classes in MMOs are available from level 1, and not including a caveat stating otherwise in the product description is tantamount to false advertising.  New players beware - you have to complete all 346 main story missions, be level 50 and have iLvl 90+ gear before you can even unlock the new classes, and then you have to grind the new class from level 30 back to 50 if you want to play expansion content with it.  The story quests include dungeons as well, so you cannot complete all of the missions solo (though the dungeon finder does makes pugging easy).   All told it is roughly 200 hours of gameplay if you focus on nothing except the main story missions and the XP grind needed to reach the level requirements for each.  It is certainly possible to do it faster if you skip through all of the dialog and cut scenes, but story is the main draw to FF14.  Also, focusing on a single class defeats the secondary draw of the game, which multi-class feature.  To really enjoy the game, new players are likely to spend much more than 200 hours before they see the expansion classes or content.",2015-06-20

That's your pre-order access code.<br />Step 5: Go back to your Mog Station, and click on &#34;Your Account&#34;<br />Step 6: On the Account screen, scroll down to the blocks of buttons under &#34;Select Service Account.&#34;<br />Step 7: One of those buttons will be labeled something along the lines of &#34;Enter Heavensward Pre-Order Access Code&#34;<br />Step 8: You'll be taken to a screen that looks just like the &#34;Redeem Item Code&#34; or &#34;License Key&#34; screens<br />Step 9: Enter (or copy+paste) in the code from the Heavensward Pre-Order Site in the boxes provided.<br />Step 10: Complete the wizard as you did for the license key.<br /><br />With any luck, you'll now have your early access and Heavensward expac.<br /><br />Seriously, Square -- you're a huge company.

The Tribute group had for years been working on their own version of the game as a labor of love, attempting to come up with something similar to the original M&M 6-8, which were the best of the bunch. When this game caught wind, we all thought it had a lot of potential.<br /><br />Turns out it ended up being a half-hearted and very old-school attempt to cash in on the legacy of the name. It turned out to be much better than that dog, M&M 9, but this was no ceegar. Still, I found the game addicting in its old school charm.<br /><br />There were several things to get used to. Having to depend on UbiPlay, for one. Then after playing so many 3-D type games like Skyrim and such and to drop down a hundred notches to 1985, it was quite a shock to play M&M 3 again. Still, I enjoyed the game. The problem is that I reached a point where I got stuck. So, off to the spotty and convoluted forums to try and get unstuck. Finally, I got just the right clue and made it past a roadblock. Then I hit another one and back to the forums again.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I find out the programmers, just gave up. They quit the project, got bored and moved on. To tell the truth, I figured they'd do that right away, especially with what little true effort they put into this game given the budget Ubisoft probably gave them when they are concentrating on all those other totally uninteresting games I don't give a flip about. This is the one game on their roster I care about and they give it barely a blink and a dime to almost ruin the name of one of the best computer game series there ever was. Sure, there are more great series, but M&M was one of the first and best.<br /><br />I had a great time playing this rude and crude attempt to cash in on the name, right up until I got stuck again and just quit. I still have maybe a few hours of hack and slash left, but have kind of lost interest, especially considering these clowns have lost interest and moved on to some sparkly vampire thing, or some demon tank battle or whatever.<br /><br />I know I'm getting a bit sarcastic here, but I can only lay some of the blame on the programmers. They did provide me with some good game play, but Ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves for shaming the M&M name with such a half-hearted attempt. If this game didn't sell well, the fault is squarely on their shoulders for not putting the budget or the heart where it should be.<br /><br />This game could've been so much better.

The enormous world is gorgeous and full of surprises, and the combat is very good, but it's  the storytelling that leaves other open-world games in the dust. Your decisions matter in a striking and sometimes heartbreaking way, and the characters are complex. On top of that, it's far less buggy than many comparable games.

7797,US,28448259,R2Q9EAPA2BMWDL,B00TUEOSMS,N,Y,Pre-Ordering Misleading,"Do not misjudge the game from the recent negative reviews, the game itself is wonderful. The bad reviews come from misleading information regarding pre-ordering from Amazon.  I think the negative reviews stem from the fact that others that pre-ordered did not get the pre-order bonus code within the 24 hours that they ordered the product. If they had stated the code for early access would be distributed on 6/19 when early access beings, then there'd be no problems, though they did not state this. The code for the actual expansion at least that you enter into the MogStation is not emailed to you, rather it is updated in the Amazon Games and Software library where the Product Code is shown in the FFXIV Heavensward product, where it did not exist before the 6/18-6/19 service update to the game. I was not attempting to get on right at the moment that the servers came on, so by the time I got around to entering all the codes, the pre-order bonus code was delivered a few hours after 2:00AM. As for the Product Code in the Amazon library, I don't know when it appeared, though it was sometime between 2:00AM and 7:00AM. So that is a bit of a shame that the early access codes did take a few hours to be distributed after the early access period officially began, though personally for me it was no issue -  not the same with everyone else apparently.  However, I am not currently eligible to even access the new Heavensward zones as I have yet to finish up to the 2.5 story quests, so I don't actually know if I can or can't even access the new content and see if the early access code worked.",2015-06-19

Hotline Miami is a retro-styled 2D video game that immerses players in a 1980‚Äôs-inspired setting with synth, neon colors, and gratuitous amounts of unabashed violence. As a nameless protagonist, players cruise through Miami in the 1980s and viciously bludgeon and mutilate mobsters in a criminal organization.<br /><br />Hotline Miami is built upon a simple premise: kill, die, and repeat. You run through level attempting to kill foes with either melee or ballistic weapons, ranging from hammers, drills, and crowbars, to katanas, shotguns, and assault rifles. The kicker? Your character will almost immediately die when hit by an enemy and respawn at the beginning for a stage. While players can use stealth to subdue enemies, Hotline Miami rewards players who aggressively engage foes with bravado and twitch reflexes to with kill combos and timing bonuses.  At the beginning of each level, the player selects a mask which grants a special perk, such as the ability to see further, start with knife, or cause enemies to have more violent death animations. The player is awarded points at the end of each mission based on their kills, combos, boldness, and speed which are then ranked in an online leaderboard.<br /><br />The game‚Äôs plot is left open for interpretation. It can effectively be summed by a mantra spoken by a character in one of the first cut-scenes: ‚ÄòDo you enjoy hurting people?‚Äô This prelude sets the stage for our morally ambiguous protagonist to go on a rampage across Miami. The game‚Äôs plot is intentionally left underdeveloped, and instead focuses on the protagonist‚Äôs brutal actions. There are a lot of interesting theories about how Hotline Miami‚Äôs plot and gameplay are actually social commentary on the state of violence and objectives in modern video games (akin to Spec Ops: The Line), but I will let you form your own opinions.  The game has twenty levels and takes roughly two or three hours to beat.<br /><br />As aforementioned, Hotline Miami succeeds in creating an atmosphere that reflects its 1980‚Äôs setting. The color pallete and art direction strongly reminisces the 80s, while the actual graphics and pixels are more akin to a creation from the early or mid ‚Äò90s. Hotline Miami‚Äôs soundtrack is one of the game‚Äôs major immersion factors. The game predominantly features ‚Äòsynthwave‚Äô music, a fusion of contemporary electronica with 80‚Äôs synth effects. Artists like Perturbator, Scattle, M|O|O|N, Sun Araw and El Huervo have contributed tracks to the game. The game‚Äôs art style and atmosphere of this game have also drawn comparisons to Drive and Cocaine Cowboys.<br /><br />All in all, Hotline Miami is a short, but very enjoyable experience. The fast-past run and smash action is frustrating at times, but also challenging and cathartic when you pull off a gruesome multi-kill combo. You will keep coming back trying to break you high-scores by using different strategies, paths, or masks. This game is a must-have if you are a fan of synth-wave music or enjoy retro-styled video games. Just remember, recklessness is rewarded.our own opinions.

7906,US,37359363,R1SGT3847L8M8U,B00US76K2M,N,Y,Calling it now - GOTY for Fighting Games,"Where do I start with this one?  It is one of those games where you get exactly what you expect and it is still great.  Solid, deep gameplay - check.  Strong story mode (which may be a surprise to those who didn't play MK9) - check.  Gratuitous violence - CHECK.  It's the most violent game I've played that doesn't feel violent.  Other games make you grimace during violent scenes, but this one makes you stare giddy as you dismember your opponent.  The characters almost feel like children's toys - you can dismember them, but they get put back together for the next time you want to take them out and play.<br /><br />For the die hard fans (myself included, considering I've owned and beaten every MK game to date), there is ample material that is a throwback to the old installments.  Story-wise, MK9 covered an alternate version of MK1-3, and MKX covers an alternate MK4 history, with Shinnok trying to take over following Shao Kahn's defeat.  Unlike the old continuity (which rehashed the same characters for 9 straight installments), this game marks a &#34;next generation&#34; turn for the franchise, with old characters getting old and retiring, and their offspring taking their place as &#34;kombatants&#34;.  This next generation works both ways - Cassie Cage (daughter of Johnny and Sonia), takes the best components of both her parents (whole &#62; sum of parts).  Alternatively, Jacqui Briggs is more of a watered down version of her father.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent game, with deep mechanics and large replay value.  Although it is coming out later this year for 360 and PS3 (as a low-res port), the PS4/XB1 version is truly one of the first games that is &#34;next gen&#34; (in contrast to many of the games that come out on next gen platforms but still feel like they could have been on the old platforms).  If you like fighting games, you probably already own this.  If you don't, it is still worth a try.",2015-06-18

I decided it was time to update my Age of Empires.  Honestly, this HD version was a fairly large let-down.  Both multiplayer and singleplayer are lacking.  While single player has new civilizations, units, and some new buildings like palisade gates and sea towers, there is no longer dialog in the campaigns.  This doesn't seem like it would be a big deal, but there is now text you have to read.  It was quite a big disappointment, as a large part of getting into the game for me was hearing the units talking and talking in their accents.  Now, instead of people speaking to you and explaining what you need to do, you need to basically stop what you are doing, and read the dialog that the game sends you which prohibits you from actually playing the game while you are trying to figure out what to do.  Also, the campaigns are somewhat dull compared to the older games and I find myself getting bored before a mission even ends.<br /><br />Multiplayer is also a joke, which is why I have the title of this review stating that the game is fun if you have someone to play with.  Why?  everyone who plays this game online either enables cheats so they over-run you in 20 seconds with the stupid racecar cheat, or if you are in a lobby where cheats are disabled, the new &#34;strategy&#34; kids are doing nowadays is to start the game with the map revealed, then everyone just builds walls around other players to trap you inside.  This is hardly a strategy, especially when they enable the map to be revealed so they can immediately see the treeline clearings, water crossings, stone mines, forage bushes, etc. so they can assume where players are starting.  In the old AOE games, players ACTUALLY PLAYED the game.  There was actually a strategy involved.  There was actually a point to playing.  Now, the games take about 20 minutes max and are quiteridiculous.  Now, if you have a friend or two, the game is very fun.  you can have different amounts of AI's or game modes and play with or against each other.  My friend and I have a blast teaming up against computers, working together and actually playing the game.  Our games last an hour or two.  But random players make the game stupid and not even fun.  If you want to play the game the way it was meant to be played, find a friend to do it with, but multiplayer is very dumb, and single player is kind of dull without the audio dialog.",2015-06-18

No matter what I put in for a password, it said it was too weak.  Connection to the steam server repeatedly failed.  I gave up.  I paid for it and can't use it.  I'm running on a 50gbs internet connection so there is absolutely no excuse for not being able to connect.  Buy Steam-based software at your own risk.  UPDATE: The game itself is good.  It's an older game so it's not as dramatic visually as the most recent releases.  Regarding installation through Steam,  this can be very complicated or even impossible.  Chances are that most people access the internet through a router.  Most routers have firewalls.  Unless you understand how to &#34;open ports&#34; in your router's firewall, you won't be able to connect to the Steam servers.  There are a lot of ports that need to be opened.  Even then, you may have to do more things.  I have an Xfinity router which includes a voice telephone line.  It took some research to figure out how to access the administrative interface and open the ports.  Even after following the directions from Steam, it still didn't work.  Then I found another setting that set various levels of security. Only after changing this to custom was I able to successfully connect to Steam and download/install COD-WAW.  All of my comments are about the process of obtaining the game.  COD-WAW is a classic.  It's fun, challenging and very entertaining.  I love the game and own quite a few COD releases.  Now that I have Steam working, I'll probably buy a few more games.  Just be aware of how problematic getting Steam working can be.",2015-06-18

Immediately I open incident with the developer of eso and the same day mentioned to contact sony because they do not see anything about me being owed 5500 crowns. So I call sony and they mention to contact the developer and amazon. So I'm thinking this is getting really annoying. So after days of going back and forth between developer, amazon and sony I still have no crowns so I'm furious.

8110,US,26630613,RH2428NKI76U5,B009XDMQ0W,N,Y,"Mass Effect Trilogy is an amazing franchise. EDIT PLEASE READ UPDATE AS OF MARCH 17,2016","One of my favorite gaming franchise. It's hard not to fall in love with each character. Love their flaws. Mass Effect 1 is the starting point to the trilogy. It sets so many events in motion, gives your hero a cause. The gameplay is what I love most. It's the perfect science fiction plot. There so much to learn about this universe. There's plenty of engaging story from each character and even more action. Since it is the PC version, the only two DLC titles are included. Both add hours of gameplay.  Mass Effect 2 is the &#34;rebirth&#34; of the hero's cause. With the ending of the first title, the character faces new challenges. Although not my favorite title from the trilogy, this game still has much to offer. It's story lacks just a little but there is plenty of action. The new combat system is possibly the best of the three games. It is balanced between an RPG game and a 3rd person shooter game. Sadly, none of the story DLC (Kasumi's memory, Lair of the Shadow Broker, Project Overlord, Arrival) are included like the PS3's version. Adding to over $30 of extra content that was only included free for the PS3.  Mass Effect 3, the final game to the trilogy is perhaps the BEST game of the whole trilogy. The story is epic, and there is no other word for it. &#34;Epic&#34; describes this title perfectly, since the journey with our hero feels like a Greek epic story. Many fans will say that this was the worst because of the ending. But for the first time players I will ask you to keep in mind that this game's story is similar to a Greek epic story. Aside from that, there is so much action. The combat system is quick and feels more like a 3rd person shooter. The weapon systems changed dramatically and it is now possible to upgrade weapons by picking and choosing your upgrades again. Sadly the game has no real mission tracking system. You'll often spend 10-15 minutes trying to figure out what your mission was and how to proceed and there is no way to mark any of your missions as priority. Aside from that there is so much DLC that all together adds nearly $50 (Leviathan, From Ashes, Citadel, Omega and Digital Deluxe Edition Upgrade). The multiplayer is fun, all the map expansions are free. It plays similar to &#34;Horde Mode&#34;.  These games offer so much and I always recommend this franchise. It has everything you'd ever want.   EDIT: EA will not release these game with full DLC for the PC or Xbox 360. I say that because getting this trilogy bundle for the PS3 gets you almost all the DLC for ME2 (the exception of Arrival). As of March 17, 2016 the newest Mass Effect title Bioware is working on has lost 3 of it's writers and lead developers (just 3 people not 6) and it seems that EA might pull off another Mass Effect 3 with day 1 DLC that is important to the franchise (From Ashes has a Prothean who joins your party, not a spoiler).  Also, I believe the download key only works on Origin. All DLC must be bought either through Origin or the Bioware website. For those of you who have a PS3 I suggest you get this game on the Playstation platform because you spend less money on DLC overall. You DO NOT get the Pinnacle Station DLC for Mass Effect 1 (which is basically an arena).",2015-06-17

8155,US,36991624,RI8NUVKKGVDI0,B00VXQBE8C,N,Y,"Fun, albeit short, prequel to Wolfenstein: New Order","VERY fun! I picked this up along with New Order at the same time, and played Old Blood first. It was a shorter campaign than New Order, but still a ton of fun, with some challenging elements that didn't exist in New Order such as the super soldiers. The story was decent, and I found New Order to be MUCH better overall in story and character development, but Old Blood was still a very fun shooter with a great feel for all the weapons, gameplay was very solid.<br /><br />As I said, the story could use some work, but for a $10 investment it provided a lot of fun fun fun hours of gameplay. The last few hours of the game were just silly (no spoilers) but still very fun despite the turn the story took. It just bugs me that since it came, chronologically, before New Order, that since New Order was published first, there was a bit of a disconnect between the somewhat unrelated stories.<br /><br />The perks were a little less easy than the ones in New Order, but still a lot of fun and added a nice gameplay element to 'upgrade' your character as well as provide some fun little challenges. None of them ever felt like a grind.<br /><br />There's a nice easter egg throwback to Wolfenstein 3D, as well, which I won't spoil. If you look for it, have fun! :D",2015-06-16

It seemed worth it because I wanted to make better armor and weapons and explore new content and gain access to new t4 components.<br /><br />Overall, the challenge level was greater than anything else in the game.  It isn't hard, per se, for an optimized character, but it is less of a breeze than it was before.  I even had to tactically retreat once or twice and actually wiped once when I was careless.  By comparison, my team has basically breezed through the other end game content.<br /><br />Also, the zone was fun, and the quests were somewhat improved over the norm in other zones.  If this zone was in the original game, it may well have been my favorite.<br /><br />However, I would caution anyone excited about the crafting aspects of the expansion.  Unfortunately, the t4 components, with the notable exception of veil quartz, are all very limited in quantity, MUCH more so than the t4 resources found in the main game.  You don't even get enough to craft one whole item if it has more than one slot that uses the material.  Ice dragon hides are t4 great bear hides, and so are an upgrade for anyone maxing crit chance or dexterity.  You get 14.  No way to get more, seemingly ever.  So that is great for one or at most two slots in one armor/weapon.  I couldn't even remake my ideal bow without it being a marginal improvement.  I opted to save my ice dragon hides in the hopes that they someday offer 20 in the black emporium, allowing me to fully max my bow.  Also, note that they offer &#34;improved&#34; versions of the previous superb t3 armors.  These versions are still t3, and are very mediocre improvements, or in the case of rogues, are not improvements at all if you prefer utility slots to defense slots.  And these new armors are just reskins of the previous top armors.<br /><br />The thing that pissed me off was that after the DLC was released, they added a new DLC for $5 that has Avvar themed armors.  These armors are certainly notimprovements over the best armors otherwise available, but they are avvar themed and appropriate to the expansion, but they charge more money for it.  So we have an expansion that is already a little light to justify the cost, and then they take content that  SHOULD be there and charge for it separately.  Not sure if I'll buy future DLC for DA, but I will certainly think hard about it after my experience with Hakkon.",2015-06-16

I have a fairly new computer but apparently I need a better video card, that's probably why. On the other hand I have played two of the games on this collection already and they are very good. I always expect good things from this company, their puzzles and HO scenes are challenging but not impossible, and there's always a good story. A big plus for this pack is &#34;Sacra Terra&#34;, it is one of the best HO games I have ever played. I would totally recommend you buy this game, it was just a letdown for me. &#62;&#62;&#62;up-date, I logged in on another computer and was able to play all the games, my review for them is as follows, 1. The Fog was really good, took at least three playing sessions to finish and had lots of creepy HO scenes and was fairly challenging, mind the story itself wasn't that creepy and the climax was weak, but still fun. 2. Sacra Terra was well worth playing again, I was a lot faster this time so only took me a couple of hours. 3. The rest of the games were O.K. not bad, not great, fine HO scenes, but weak stories. except Summer Camp, it was just weak all round, poor graphics, mediocre HO scenes, the annoying habit of making you have to click the exact right spot to make an action work, and a tired story. But, four out of five is good, especially for the price, so 4 out of 5 stars is my rating.",2015-06-15

8264,US,40788541,R3HCWXJPIPM8YA,B00RXFIMQO,N,N,"Despite its gripping story and enormous potential, Mechs & Mercs has two absolutely fatal flaws for any squad-based RTS title","Thank you Kasedo Games for providing us with a copy of this game to review!<br /><br />For many years, the United Space Federation maintained a tenuous peace throughout the galaxy. But a devastating war left the U.S.F. in tatters. Old grudges were reignited in the embers of the dying federation as various factions vied for power. The strongest of these, the Tzanar Union, wasted little time in asserting its dominance through conquest, at first gobbling up small, backwater colonies. But now their target is the prosperous Oberon system.<br /><br />In response to the invasion, Oberon's leaders sounded a call to arms, pleading for the help of any mercenary group willing to come to their aid. Among others, the Black Talons company answered the desperate call. But when the enemy blockaded Oberon's stargate, the Black Talons became trapped in the system. Now their only hope for survival lay in driving out the invaders. The battle for Oberon had begun!<br /><br />Mechs and Mercs: Black Talons is a squad-based, real time strategy (RTS) game where players will command the Black Talons as they battle to survive. In-game time is primarily spent in missions, directly controlling your squads and 'Mobile Combat Units.' Known colloquially as M.C.U.s, or 'mechs,' these large war machines carry devastating weaponry, and are capable of turning the tide of any battle. The time between missions is spent aboard the Paladin, the company's battlecruiser and mobile headquarters. It is here that players are able to accept new missions, level up their squads, and perform other actions. As a mercenary company, missions are given in the form of contracts. These are worth varying amounts of money which the player can use to hire new squads, purchase mechs, and invest in various upgrades. Contracts also have timers which determine how long they are available for - when a timer runs out, the contract expires.<br /><br />Squads, as well as mechs and their pilots, are persistent. Through missions they can gain experience and therefore receive new abilities, becoming more valuable as the game progresses. Therefore it's vitally important to try and keep them alive as long as possible. Unfortunately this is war, and as such, soldiers will die. But take heart; with enough grit, smarts, and patience, the day can be won and victory achieved.<br /><br />The central tenant of gameplay is the maneuvering of a player's forces to flank the enemy. In doing so, players can gain the advantage, allowing smaller groups to defeat superior forces - at least in theory. In keeping with this style of gameplay, there are three general squad types: light, medium, and heavy. Each type is defined by their role, weapons, armor type, and movement speed. Heavier squads are used to soak up damage and distract the enemy, providing lighter squads an opportunity to flank and destroy. It's a great concept, but is sadly eclipsed by the game's problems.<br /><br />Despite its gripping story and enormous potential, Mechs & Mercs has two absolutely fatal flaws for any squad-based RTS title. Namely: a lack of hotkeys, and an absolute dearth of cover. The result is a grossly artificial level of difficulty. While a challenge is good, and casualties are inevitable, these issues so hamper the core gameplay that it's reduced to a disappointing, and frustrating meat grinder.<br /><br />In good RTS titles, every command has an assigned hotkey which allows players to issue commands almost-instantaneously. This is vitally important in the swirling maelstrom of combat, when giving various commands to different units is an exercise in almost-controlled chaos. This is especially crucial for quickly activating key unit abilities, such as retreating to prevent a unit from being wiped out. But in Mechs & Mercs, only a small fraction of the commands actually have hotkeys! This so greatly impacts the speed at which the player is able to control units in the heat of battle, that any such abilities are delayed to thepoint of irrelevance by the time a player painstakingly clicks across the clunky UI.<br /><br />The second devastating problem is a desperate lack of cover. In real-life firefights, cover is often the difference between life and death. To be caught in the open, without it, is an almost-certain invitation to get hit. As such, soldiers in combat will use almost anything as cover, even going prone, and wishing for the buttons on their shirts to be gone, so as to be that much closer to the ground. Even mediocre squad-based RTS games generally provide your soldiers with enough life-saving cover to make highly-mobile warfare, at a squad level, viable. In Mechs & Mercs however, cover is so unbelievably scarce that most fights involve one or both sides in the open, creating a slaughter that's more painful to watch than fun to play. When used occasionally, such a deficit can present a fun challenge, forcing the player to break from cover, and work quickly to aggressively flank and overwhelm an enemy position. But this game actually seems built upon such a gimmick.<br /><br />Either of these issues, if alone, would be bad enough. When combined however, the lack of hotkeys and cover actually blend into a perfect storm that's greater than the sum of its individual parts. This causes every firefight to devolve into a brutal game of roshambo, the winner of which is determined simply by who brought more troops. This of course ruins the appeal of a squad-based RTS game, and makes even the best tactics extraneous.<br /><br />Despite all the gameplay problems, the graphics and sounds are pretty good. Graphically, both the individual soldiers and mechs are detailed and move smoothly. Effects like muzzle flashes and explosions are rendered sufficiently, if nothing spectacular. The maps are visually appealing, and provide enough variety to remain interesting. The soundtrack is decent, and doesn't detract from the experience. Although it can become a bit repetitive. The sound effects are okay, but explosions tend to be at a much higher volume, effectively drowning out all other sound for a second or two... which is the most realistic part of this game.<br /><br />As a squad-based RTS game, soldiers are regularly seen killing one another in battle. However there is little blood, and no gore. In about thirty hours of gameplay, I didn't come across any foul language, nudity, or other potentially morally-objectionable material.<br /><br />Mechs and Mercs: Black Talons, while not an awful game, is a strange blend of sterling potential, and bitter disappointment. It has so much going for it: a gritty and engaging story, tough-as-nails difficulty, and the foundations of a truly solid tactical game. Yet it feels wholly unfinished and dismally unpolished, as if rushed to Steam before it was actually finished. It's got an interesting gameplay concept, and is more than challenging-enough to provide a few hours of fun. Nevertheless, to date, it fails in two vitally important areas for any game of its genre. At the end of the day, this is a twenty dollar game that delivers not a penny more.point of irrelevance by the time a player painstakingly clicks across the clunky UI.<br /><br />The second devastating problem is a desperate lack of cover.

And by this point we already know that CD Projekt Red knows how to deliver on their RPGs.  The Witcher is a huge game that takes about 37 hours to beat the main story and over 150 hours to 100% complete the game.  We're going over the highlights.  Let's take a closer look at the Witcher 3 and how this game stands out from the crowd in this quick review.<br /><br />The Witcher 3 is a very in depth RPG that's easy to pick up and hard to master.  The tutorial is very step by step and explains all of the complex mechanics that allow you to play the game properly.  But at the same time, it's intuitive.  Even during the first few moments, the game flows well.  From the first hour of the game the story teaches you basic combat and introduces you to the open world.  Objectives are very directed and easy to get to on your horse.  All of these features make the game seamless and that's what makes the Witcher 3 so amazing.  It never takes you out of the gameplay.  You rarely find yourself stuck whether it's due to the lack of directive, the story, or the challenge.  That's why it's one of the game that you can't put down.<br /><br />The story and the world of Witcher is continually pushing the boundaries of immersion.  The Witcher's story is complex, ongoing, and properly woven into the gameplay.  Each cutscene and each mission is very specifically directed and evokes emotion.  The way people react to your character, Geralt,  gets you lost in the story.  You really feel for Geralt and his troubles as being a Witcher.  It's the battle of every hero.  He's got great power, but a lot of responsibility.  People demand him to do dirty work for them, but see him as an outcast and a killer.  And of course Geralt has always been a ladies man, and his romance scenes are a story of their own.  Even conversation trees keep you on your toes and expose the true emotions of the characters.  It's not the type of game where you put your controller down during a cutscene.<br /><br />The graphics in Witcher 3, especially on the PC version, are really top notch.  And it's not just about how many effects it's pushing.  It's the way it's used.  The day/night cycle is the most detailed out of any game.  It literally tells you the time and weather condition in the upper right corner.  And the weather gradually changes from cloudy to rainy to sunny again.  Looking up at the sky, you get lost in how attractive it looks.  Traveling through the world, it really feels alive.  Not just in towns, but even between towns.  On the roads there are small homes, traveling soldiers, and many areas to explore.  It contributes to the seamless nature of The Witcher 3.  Nothing feels like filler.<br /><br />The combat in Witcher 3 is straight up fun.  Who doesn't like swinging a big sword in melee combat?  You engage in close quarter melee combat as well as fighting huge creatures.  You also have spells and potions to modify your attributes.<br /><br />CD Projekt Red is also one of the most honest game devs.  The PC version has no DRM if you purchase on GOG.com.  And they are one of the few publisher who will release a high amount of free DLC.<br /><br />The Witcher 3 is a massive game with high ambitions and it gets almost all of them right.  It's beautiful to look at, it's fun to play and it's accessible to almost anyone.  Unless you are highly averse to RPGs, you definitely want to pick up the Witcher 3 and start slayin!

It's not the type of game where you put your controller down during a cutscene.<br /><br />The graphics in Witcher 3, especially on the PC version, are really top notch.  And it's not just about how many effects it's pushing.  It's the way it's used.  The day/night cycle is the most detailed out of any game.  It literally tells you the time and weather condition in the upper right corner.  And the weather gradually changes from cloudy to rainy to sunny again.  Looking up at the sky, you get lost in how attractive it looks.  Traveling through the world, it really feels alive.  Not just in towns, but even between towns.  On the roads there are small homes, traveling soldiers, and many areas to explore.  It contributes to the seamless nature of The Witcher 3.

They may have changed their policy, but at that time they required a credit card on the account to use Xbox live when you purchased a subscription via your Xbox. Xbox live is the last thing many of us are thinking about, so it's easy to forget to remove your credit card at the end of their subscription. And since it has been difficult to get them to refund these unauthorized charges, this is the only way I will ever purchase Xbox live for my kids from now on.

I also suggest you join a Free company (clan/guild) it becomes way more fun to play than it is to do it alone. If you can get your friends, that's even better.

But the set up for this game through Orgin is not. Due to this game being purchase for an older person signing in all the time was a big inconvenient .The games stop running after not signing in for a long period of time which they set it up that way. It asked for me to sign in and input the product code which I had done the first time. It wouldn't take it. So I couldn't get the game to play.  I do believe the company that distributes this game does not want my business again. So I will not purchase items from Orgin. Very disappointed in this as well as my mother.<br />It seems I am out of my money as well.,2015-06-14

With Amazon having a great deal a little while ago I just couldn't pass up the chance to try it out.<br /><br />Set in 1986 Seattle after a global event that plunged the world into chaos and destroyed most of life on earth. Playing as Randall Wayne, a man looking for his friends and family and bring them to safety, the player must avoid the Shadows, a zombie like foe that plagues the game, and also battle the living that are trying to survive as well.<br />Deadlight has a dark story but borrows heavily from major zombie movies that one can almost guess it while playing and really is hard to feel compelled to finish the game. The cinematic scenes are really the only thing that kept me going as it's motion graphics was like Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel which were quite interesting.<br />The game is also dark to give the feel of dread with the graphics being styled with grit and the gameplay limiting the player with either limited resources or nothing but to have the player run for safety. The only problem is that sometimes the game put the player in tough situations that cause more frustration than enjoyment with Shadows swarming before the player can do anything or being unable to do basic platforming to get away.<br />The sounds and FX are basic suspenseful tracks and zombie moans but the most annoying thing is the cinematic scenes are not adjustable and blasted out my speakers with little warning.<br /><br />I love the post-apocalypse settings and was very interested in Deadlight when I heard about it but after hearing that it wasn't that great of a game I hesitated. And after playing, the review were not unfounded and Deadlight should only be bought by post-apocalypse fans and only",2015-06-13

The game allows you to create characters that live in Skyrim; a land on Tamriel that is primarily settled by Nords, a fierce rugged people who love a good fight and are prepared to defend their homeland.  The land is currently under the rule of the Imperials and this struggle against good vs. bad is central to everything that happens.  The question is:  Who is &#34;good&#34; and who is &#34;bad&#34;?  It's up to your player to live among the people of Skyrim.  Choose your story.  Choose your friends.  But most of all, choose your side.",2015-06-12

8646,US,452646,R1IWHXQFCHXNSW,B00XLT8338,N,N,Lots of strategy to be had in this space simulation for your PC,"When we previewed Galactic Civilizations III back in September of 2014 we were very excited by what we saw. The return of one of, if not the best space-based strategy title was almost too good to be true. Six-plus months later and Stardock has officially released the civilization simulator in space, Galactic Civilizations III. Was the wait worth it? Read on for more info!<br /><br />During the preview session, and through most of the Early Access for GalCiv III the most noticeable issue was the game's performance. Simply put it was quite poor at times. Some of the larger, more star-abundant maps would run at about 15 FPS on a well-endowed gaming rig. Now that the game has released though, and when I load up a similar map, I saw the framerate drop below 60 once, and that was likely because while playing multiplayer with another contributor here, Pierre-Yves, his game crashed which caused a hiccup on my side.<br /><br />Fortunately though you can save the state of the game and reload the multiplayer session, allowing you to jump right back into the fray. In the preview build the ship building tool was dreadfully slow, averaging 8-10 frames per second; in the full release though, the game stayed at 60 FPS. Really the ship builder is where I ended up spending a ton of time, which is not all that bad given that games can, and will, last hours upon hours upon hours ‚Ä¶ upon hours. In the 4.5 hour long multiplayer session with Pierre-Yves it was not until about 3.5 hours in that we actually found each other on the map. GalCiv III is not for the impatient. At all.<br /><br />On top of the wildly improved performance, Galactic Civilizations III's full release improves the balancing of the various races as well as allows you to fully create and customize your own races, even giving them a back story and lore if you would like. Once you are done creating your own race, or choosing one of the well-rounded existing races it is on to choosing your galaxy sizes. Some sizes, like the gargantuan sized maps are still unavailable (to be activated later on in the release cycle), but even on the &#34;normal&#34; sized maps you may spend hours before you get out and are able to locate any other players. Like most civilization builders the first few turns are fairly straightforward; explore and research.<br /><br />Once you get some exploration under your belt and are able to begin making a profit and building units / colonies at affordable prices it is a race to expanding. I found that most combat-focused games tend to end in the same way; aggressively expand and build up your forces towards the end of the game, then simply zerg the enemy. In one particular map I spent a solid three to four hours whittling down one of two enemy opponents only to have the second opponent swoop in and destroy the last few planets of the third race. From there it was a battle of attrition where I was simply expending planets and space stations to stay alive. After another four hours I was finally defeated. This very same scenario happened in nearly every single game where Conquest (destruction of the other races) was the victory condition.<br /><br />Combat is not the only victory condition though, and some games, such as those tied to the Relics or through economic and political means. Each particular victory condition is unique and can yield some interesting games, though I am partial to the extremely long and drawn out conquest-oriented games. While I like the concept of economically destroying an enemy, if there is anything that GalCiv III has shown me it is that economics are not my strong suit.<br /><br />Outside of some balancing issues and the performance issues in the Preview build from September, Galactic Civilizations III remains largely unchanged, and that is in no way a bad thing. Most matches will last hours, though in my case I spent a ton of time designing my own ships (which most will undoubtedly do), but rarely will it ever feel like it is too long.Balance is excellent and every option, from research to trade to planet diplomacy is easily accessible without digging through menu after menu. Galactic Civilizations III is, without a doubt, the best civilization simulator I have played in years.Balance is excellent and every option, from research to trade to planet diplomacy is easily accessible without digging through menu after menu.

8667,US,452646,R2Z4S7S69FKR01,B00WX05SE8,N,N,A solid expansion on an already great game,"We at Chalgyr's Game Room have been pretty big fans of Endless Legend since we first previewed it back in September '14 and when it officially released we were quite happy with the end results. Since then Amplitude Studios has done a wonderful job patching the game, removing any balancing issues or the odd bug here and there, not to mention taking community feedback to heart. After six months or so, Amplitude has finally released the first DLC for Endless Legend, Guardians, which adds new units (the Guardians) as well as new features like Legendary Deeds, co-op / competitive quests, global events, and new buildings. Does the Guardians expansion add to this already bursting fantasy strategy title? Read on for our review!<br /><br />Given how thrilled I was with the core game I was more than pumped when Guardians showed up on my desk; after all anything to spice up the already fantastic gameplay is a good thing (assuming it does not break the game). Guardians adds five new super units that, on their own, are capable of laying waste to entire armies. While at times they feel a bit over powered each has its own unique capabilities (such as the Dust guardian's support capabilities allowing it to heal friendly armies) that only enhance, not break, the balancing aspects of Endless Legend.<br /><br />On the other hand the Guardians take significant time and investments to get to (the first is available in the third research tree) and by then they may not necessarily be needed, depending on your play style. For more combat-heavy games the Guardians are certainly an asset but they are not necessarily required to get through a match.<br /><br />The Guardians are not all that were added to Endless Legend though, as the Legendary Deeds and Legendary Buildings are new goals to work for. You can find the Legendary Deeds/Buildings in the left-hand pane of the Research window where you can find the new Deeds and Buildings and how to attain them. Each era has a few rewards that are rewarded based on your performance (such as defeating armies or collecting certain types of loot).<br /><br />Some of the Deeds yield empire-wide bonuses or a huge stockpile of resources, however, each Deed is competitive and if you are not the first civilization to complete the Deed requirements then you will not get that deed and the rewards will go to the first team to satisfy the needs of said Deed. In a similar vein there are a handful of open-world, competitive or cooperative quests such as working to remove debuffs from some of the minor factions. In a way it is Amplitude working to pull players out of their comfort zones and for the most part it works, though given that it pulls you out of your comfort zone it can be a bit tedious.<br /><br />The fun does not end there though as Legendary Buildings, which are akin to Relics or Wonders in games like Civilization,  were added in Guardians. Like other titles, the Legendary Buildings are massive and will each boost a region of the map, providing various buffs and victory conditions. A nice addition and as you play it more and more you begin to wonder why they were not added in the core game.<br /><br />All in all Endless Legend: Guardians is a solid expansion with some new neat features. The addition of the Guardians themselves was nice but not really all that necessary, though the new competitive/co-op quests, global events and the addition of the Legendary Deeds and Buildings round out the expansion and add a lot of new gameplay features without really breaking the game.ewarded based on your performance (such as defeating armies or collecting certain types of loot).<br /><br />Some of the Deeds yield empire-wide bonuses or a huge stockpile of resources, however, each Deed is competitive and if you are not the first civilization to complete the Deed requirements then you will not get that deed and the rewards will go to the first team to satisfy the needs of said Deed.

8672,US,452646,R31WA4HIHJYTNK,B00UBWNZL8,N,N,"Some really good ideas, but the execution can be lacking","I‚Äôve seen and played a lot of Indie RPGs over the years with a lot of them coming from RPG Makers but never have I seen one simply this ambitious. Forget saying goodbye to your parents and your hometown. Forget the idea of scaling mountains and deserts on quests for glory and fame. Fortune‚Äôs Tavern instead places you, a member of a specific bloodline, as the owner of a Tavern and its surrounding lands which have but one function. Keep an ancient and sealed Evil where it is least it break out and once again wreak destruction upon the lands. If that wasn‚Äôt enough to have to worry about, the Tavern is in need of much repair and you‚Äôve got drinks to serve if you are going to get enough money to patch this place up.<br /><br />Starting off the tavern really is in quite poor repair. Being the newest person in charge there is a lot that you are going to need to take care of if you are to bring this place up to its former glory to prevent the release of the once ancient and great evil. Starting off with nothing more than several hundred dollars to buy a couple beds, quests are going to need to be completed to whip this place up into shape so that more people are going to be willing to come in for drinking and sleeping. Be prepared however as this is no easy task.<br /><br />Fortune‚Äôs Tavern is definitely something different and out of the box from a standard RPG. Being in charge of the Tavern has its own merits as technically you do not need to lift a finger when it comes to taking on quests to obtain money and materials. Instead of equipping yourself with armours and weapons, a selected pet takes care of the fighting for you. These pets come in a variety of power categories that only become more efficient the stronger the rating. If the starting pets don‚Äôt quite cut it don‚Äôt worry, more powerful pets can be acquired through questing and these are more than able to hold their own and protect you all at the same time.<br /><br />Where the ambitions really show through are on the sheer size of everything from the maps to the insides of buildings. Instead of simply moving from point to point and having the camera follow if necessary, the camera actually softly glides over before actually moving along giving a lot more of a cinematic feel to it. Dialogs have custom bubbles that differentiate between actual dialog and internal monologues and system messages for the player. The sheer amount of work and detail was amazing to look at.<br /><br />Following through from the visual designs everything else also happens on screen. There are no battle intros and commands to be imputed. Instead the player simply walks across the map and if there are enemies your pet will seek out and attempt to destroy anything that would otherwise cross your path. This is a bit where things can start to fall down to a crawl at times. Because of everything already on screen there goes from being a bit to a lot of lag at times when multiple enemies show up on an already very decorated screen. At first I thought it may have just been my laptop not properly processing it all but when my desktop had the same issues both inside and out of fullscreen I saw that it was more than that. There are currently a number of issues that are being worked on to improve the performance but as of this writing those issues have not yet been solved.<br /><br />While your pets can fight for you it doesn‚Äôt mean that you are out of luck if you get separated from your pet when the enemies come calling for you. Given to you while starting off for defensive purposes is a rune that allows for the casting of a very useful and flashy fireball. This spell isn‚Äôt free to cast and should only be used in worst case scenarios but sometimes those can include terrible AI choices where your pet simply pushes against the enemy instead of attacking. Because there are no menus, there is no way to modify a pet‚Äôs behavior or adjust its commands. It could just happen out of the blue that a pet currently going to town on the enemies would just stop with no way to get them to continue the fight and having to exit the area because there is not enough magic power left for you to cast a spell and defeat the enemies.<br /><br />Overall Fortune‚Äôs Tavern has a lot of potential as it is still be worked on however the issues that can occur make it hard to enjoy at times. The shear lag and inconsistent pet and ally AI made it frustrating at times especially when no mana was left to launch a fireball in order to take care of things yourself. I hope to see more fixes in the near future and see Fortune‚Äôs Tavern live up to its ambitions. That being said, because Fortune‚Äôs Tavern is still being worked on to fix the issues that it currently has, I want to revisit this in a little bit of time because it has a lot of potential with everything that it set out to do and I would really like to see it pull it off.et currently going to town on the enemies would just stop with no way to get them to continue the fight and having to exit the area because there is not enough magic power left for you to cast a spell and defeat the enemies.<br /><br />Overall Fortune‚Äôs Tavern has a lot of potential as it is still be worked on however the issues that can occur make it hard to enjoy at times.

The PC version doesn't do anything to fix what was wrong with the game to begin with (so if you were turned off by the game already, you'll still be disappointed), but between SweetFX/ReShade, mods, and the bundled DLC, it ends up being a MUCH better game and value than the console version (on a system that can run it, that is.

The port is pretty bad, but I have not had ANY issues. A controller isn't necessary once you get used to the relatively simplistic PC controls. The game itself runs very smooth.. I definitely wouldn't worry.<br /><br />As for the game itself, it's got that challenging and frustrating feel to it, but it also feels fair and balanced. If you die, you can't say the game is &#34;too hard&#34; or &#34;rigged.&#34; You die because the lack of strategy/skill or even something so simple as evading a second too soon. The game is never to blame. With that said, it's literally the only game that I've come across that has been able to challenge me.<br /><br />For all the PC players, here's the default keyboard map:<br /><br />Tab = dodge attack and retaliate (hardly works)<br />Space bar = run/jump/roll<br />Shift = block<br />Alt = two-hand your weapon<br />W, A, S, D = move forward, right, backward, left; respectively<br />E = Use item selected in utility slot (i.e. Flask)<br />F = Change item selected in utility slot<br />H = Generic attack<br />U = Strong attack<br />J, I, L, K = Look to the left, up, right, or downards; respectively<br />End = Open menu<br />Page up/Down = Navigate through menu<br />Enter = Select<br /><br />As aforementioned, it's really easy if you get the hang of it.

I have had a bass for about 20+ years and have never been able to play (every time I tried, I would get frustrated and put it back in the case for a few years).  This software has taken me from no skills to AWESOME skills!  I'm playing along with songs I would never imagined when I first started learning.  I now keep up with my bass playing (after over a year), so this WORKS!<br /><br />I'm in my mid-forties, and I was able to pick this up and start playing.  I now play a ton of songs (see my note below too!!) and am so happy.  This was the BEST hundred bucks I paid in my life (btw, you do need the cable if you haven't read in other reviews).<br /><br />Important note:  If you get this for PC, be SURE to visit the forums where users post their own songs (the software comes with a lot of songs, plus you can pay for a bunch more if you wanted, but it's free this other way).  I have a couple hundred songs (that I hand picked - my favs from my music genre) and have found that on the PC you can gain a library of thousands of songs to play in rocksmith if you take the time to download them (I don't want to get in trouble for suggesting the actual site, but a quick google search should quickly find your way there - it used to be called Custom Forge I think (the old site)).",2015-06-10

8803,US,49702977,R4CH8XCDSFHNY,B00T6T9B5G,N,Y,A Tempered Tale,"As my first Assassin's Creed Game, I must say that I am impressed with Rogue. It has been criticized since its release as innovative and somewhat unnecessary. I disagree, as I have come to see that Black Flag is nearly identical in game play and format. I am fine with this as it is a fun game overall and worth the money spent (Luckily during deal, got it for $12.50). The best part is by far the naval capability, being able to sail from the arctic to Albany to NYC. Along the way you can fight other ships (which is great fun), and sink them or board them, gaining you wealth and supplies that you can get to pimp out your ship and also your weapons. I must admit that the story is good, and Shay is an excellent main character. The story doesn't truly get rolling though until the end of the second sequence and it gets really good. I would say that the biggest faults are the combat which is slow and lethargic, very non fluid. I had heard that they would adapt the combat system of the Batman: Arkham series which by the way is fantastic and I highly recommend. But, they just add a counter move that often doesn't work and is unresponsive. I would hope that they would use something akin the combat in Shadow of Mordor, which also is quite good. Bottom line, just stick to assassinating or using gadgets or you will get wrecked. Another fault (which may just be with the Assassin's Creed series) is the abstergo parts which are honestly dumb and pointless, I would have just preferred for Shay's story than have to run around an office building fixing serves while a vulgar superior yells at you (trust me if I wanted to go into IT I would have), and having no interesting point. In review though if you avoid the abstergo parts, and just stick around in 18th Century North America it is great fun with hours of extra side missions and content to explore for, leaving you playing Rogue for many voyages to come.",2015-06-10

I will say that I waited a long time before I purchased the DLC. In fact, I waited until I had an Amazon gift card to buy it. It wasn't that I felt the DLC would be bad, in fact it added several hours of enjoyable game time, but it was the price. To be totally honest, after paying $60 for the initial game, paying $15 for each DLC was getting a bit much. I felt this honestly should have been part of the first release and that paying the additional money, site unseen, was a bit over the top.<br /><br />If you are looking for a worthwhile DLC I would suggest this one over the shore leave/citadel DLC for several reasons. Omega added to the story line and gave some good insight into the characters that otherwise goes untouched. Citadel, though enjoyable, just didn't give any insights and it seemed to be more of a fan service type &#34;fun time&#34; DLC for those wanting some personal &#34;downtime&#34; windows into the characters and some release from the seriousness of the overall ME3 feel.<br /><br />Is it worth $15 though? That's up to you. For me it was not. It was good, it was enjoyable, it does add to the overall game feel, but the timing of the DLC release of Omega was a bit too &#34;after the fact&#34; for my tastes.",2015-06-08

9006,US,11966608,RHILPU5CS7ZI1,B00GXHJGVI,N,Y,"Good, but Morrowind is better","I really have enjoyed this game so far, however it isn't as good as Morrowind or Oblivion. I love how there are so many different things that can be done and how you aren't forced to do anything like the other games, but I feel like it lacks some of the depth of previous games. A lot of times it seems like people only exist to give you quests rather than living their own lives. NPCs don't seem to have nearly as much dialogue as in previous games. In Morrowind, they had a lot to say and their view of you was based on your affiliations, and they generally seemed to distrust you. You actually had to earn their respect by completing quests. In Skyrim, while people do have opinions over the war, they just don't seem to have that same level of depth. Quests also seem to be more of a go here do this kind of quest with little thought. While there are puzzles, they just give you the answer on some item you have or in the room itself. It lacks much of the thought required in previous games. This downfall started with the addition of quest markers in Oblivion, which while nice, makes it too easy. While Morrowind was annoying because finding the place took so long, quest markers just give everything away and ruin the fun. A better solution might be to have a general area highlighted rather than a marker. The game also seems to be designed to prevent you from failing. You really can't make choices that doom the game like you could in Morrowind. I think that they dumbed down the game to appeal to more gamers, but at the cost of the fans of the series. I still enjoy the game despite these issues, but I prefer Morrowind. I also like how this gives you a steam code for the game which is really convenient. I would recommend checking out Enderal which is a new game based on the Skyrim game engine, but it'll be an RPG that fixes many of these issues. It should be coming out soon.",2015-06-07

It's quite pleasing to see the game grow to the point where Out of the Park Developments has partnered with MLB.  That license allows the game to tap into more than a centuries worth of MLB collateral.  This allows for historical logo use that changes over time.  That sort of automation is a godsend for historical players.  Plus, the main skin this season is a very pleasant red, white and blue one that is a nice play on the MLB league logo.  That's a vast improvement over last year's dead green jello look.<br /><br />I love being the GM of a small market club that lacks the resources of the Yankees or Dodgers.

9117,US,35283097,RBJBPUX7SWF03,B009XDMQ0W,N,N,A fantastic journey with a lackluster ending. Worth it. Very worth it.,"This is a wonderful series--always gripping, even through the most questionable parts of the series. The first game is good, the second is fantastic, and the third is very good (with the exception of the ending).<br /><br />In Mass Effect 1, you'll see the formation of the main group (for the most part) and the event that set the trilogy in motion. It's probably the black sheet of the trilogy, with gameplay and pacing very reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins, another Bioware game that came about two years later.<br /><br />Mass Effect 2 is phenomenal, beginning to end. The pacing, gameplay, story, voice acting, sound, music.... Everything ties together in a cohesive whole that makes for an unforgettable experience. This is definitely the high point of the series, and no matter what you think of the first game, it's worth playing through just to get to this one.<br /><br />Mass Effect 3 carries the brilliance of the second game for as long as it can. It builds and builds, creating incredible tension and raising the stakes to the point that they probably couldn't have made an ending that would be justified. That being said, the ending doesn't even approach that level; sadly, it sort of tapers off in a meaningless sequence that lasts a few minutes and sort of throws everything you did out the window. All major choices in the game simply change a few seconds in each shot of the final sequence, and you don't feel like you've made the galaxy-ending choices that were supposed to be coming. That's the biggest issue for most people. Mass Effect is a series about choice, consequence, success, loss, love, regret, almost every emotion and hot topic there is, and it compacts it nicely into a little, sterile, almost irrelevant ending that can't come close to the 75-100 hours of gameplay and story leading up to it.<br /><br />Please, don't let this discourage you. Despite the ending, the entire series--even the third game--is absolutely worth playing. It's about the journey, not the destination, and the journey through this trilogy is one of the best in gaming.",2015-06-06
9118,US,31848130,R26XHBU8WNODWR,B00KXAGTV6,N,Y,Do not buy it,"About one year ago, I bought Max Payne 3 from Amazon. After downloading it and installing it, it didn't run. More precisely, it got stuck on the loading screen. After some research, I downloaded a patch and, finally, was able to play. I am going to repeat this: I bought a legit copy of Rockstar Games Max Payne 3 and, for it to run, I had to download a patch from some sleazy website which name I don't even remember.<br /><br />So: GTA V. I should have known better after my experience with Max Payne 3, but I bought it nonetheless. 65 bucks. I painstakingly downloaded it, installed it and, surprise, it doesn't load. More precisely, it gets stuck on the Social Club loading screen. For those who don't know, Social Club is a Rockstar feature nobody gives a damn about and which serves one purpose only: making things more complicated for those who only want to play the game, which is everybody. The game doesn't do anything. Hell, I haven't even got to the point where I have to enter the purchase verification code. Eternal loading. If someone doesn't believe me and thinks I'm trying to slander Rockstar because I have some long-standing grudge against them, just type this on Google: GTA V Social Club eternal loading.<br /><br />And here we are. Amazon obviously doesn't want to hear anything about a refund and, after a week of fruitless troubleshooting attempts by Rockstar support team, I've given up hope by now. I've made peace with myself, I've written this off as a bad purchase and I've assumed that, basically, I've thrown 65 bucks to the dustbin. However, I have extracted a valuable lesson, albeit an expensive one, from this mess: never buy a videogame again. If you want to play a game, go to a website which name starts by ThePirate and ends by Bay. Because if you buy a legit copy and then one of these stupid, wishy-washy features developers love so much prevents you from playing the game, all you gonna get in the end is a big &#34;Screw you&#34;.",2015-06-06

9145,US,95629,R38J6XGRZ39MUE,B00XCRT0GS,N,N,One of the best RPGs to date!,"Huge game of the year contender! The Witcher 3 is a fantastic blend of intricate story-telling and a compelling combat system. It ends up being over 100 hours of gameplay for a mere $60, and honestly you could probably get closer to 200 hours if you decide to go through all of the side content.<br /><br />The story is an absolute pleasure! Choices have actual consequences, most of which aren't immediately noticeable and only come into play much later in the game. Characters are fleshed out and feel very &#34;real&#34;, even some of the less important side characters are memorable and will stick with you.<br /><br />This game definitely has a few problems, one of which is the number of bugs that can really impact gameplay. That being said, I feel they aren't a large concern as of the time of this review, CDPR has just released patch 1.05 which fixes a numerous amount of bugs and introduces a number of performance tweaks.<br /><br />Also, if you are having problems with GOG, just use their beta Galaxy launcher. It works just like Steam or Origin, you just click download and then play when it's ready, very simple!",2015-06-06
